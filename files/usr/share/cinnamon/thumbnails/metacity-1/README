 HOW TO MAKE A METACITY THUMBNAIL?
 ---------------------------------

 - Install ImageMagick ("apt install imagemagick")
 - Open a window (Nemo for instance)
 - Press Alt+Print-Screen to take a screenshot of the window
 - Go to your Pictures directory and move the screenshot to ~/screenshot.png
 - Open a terminal and type:

	cd
	convert screenshot.png -gravity north-east -extent 100x32 thumbnail.png

 WHICH THUMBNAIL IS USED BY CINNAMON TO REPRESENT A THEME?
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 - Cinnamon first tries to find a metacity-1/thumbnail.png file in the theme directory
 - If it doesn't find any, it looks in /usr/share/cinnamon/thumbnails/metacity-1/
