This script is now just a wrapper around the cinnamon-xlet-makepot utility.
It is kept for backwards compatibility as it is currently used by other scripts
(notably the cinnamon-spices-makepot script found in the 3rd party spices repos).

for usage info type:
cinnamon-xlet-makepot -h
* Note that the Javascript arguement is inverted because previously Javascript files
were not scanned by default, but now are.
