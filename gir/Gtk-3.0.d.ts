	 * The GtkAboutDialog offers a simple way to display information about
	 * a program like its logo, name, copyright, website and license. It is
	 * also possible to give credits to the authors, documenters, translators
	 * and artists who have worked on the program. An about dialog is typically
	 * opened when the user selects the `About` option from the `Help` menu.
	 * All parts of the dialog are optional.
	 * 
	 * About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. GtkAboutDialog
	 * displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls {@link Gtk.show.uri_on_window}
	 * when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
	 * {@link AboutDialog.activate_link} signal.
	 * 
	 * To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
	 * "Edgar Allan Poe <edgar\#poe.com>". To specify a website with a title,
	 * use a string like "GTK+ team http://www.gtk.org".
	 * 
	 * To make constructing a GtkAboutDialog as convenient as possible, you can
	 * use the function gtk_show_about_dialog() which constructs and shows a dialog
	 * and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.
	 * 
	 * Note that GTK+ sets a default title of `_("About %s")` on the dialog
	 * window (where \%s is replaced by the name of the application, but in
	 * order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
	 * set the title property explicitly when constructing a GtkAboutDialog,
	 * as shown in the following example:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GdkPixbuf *example_logo = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file ("./logo.png", NULL);
	 * gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
	 *                        "program-name", "ExampleCode",
	 *                        "logo", example_logo,

	 * The {@link AccelLabel} widget is a subclass of #GtkLabel that also displays an
	 * accelerator key on the right of the label text, e.g. “Ctrl+S”.
	 * It is commonly used in menus to show the keyboard short-cuts for commands.
	 * 
	 * The accelerator key to display is typically not set explicitly (although it
	 * can be, with {@link Gtk.AccelLabel.set_accel}). Instead, the #GtkAccelLabel displays
	 * the accelerators which have been added to a particular widget. This widget is
	 * set by calling gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget().
	 * 
	 * For example, a #GtkMenuItem widget may have an accelerator added to emit
	 * the “activate” signal when the “Ctrl+S” key combination is pressed.
	 * A #GtkAccelLabel is created and added to the #GtkMenuItem, and
	 * gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget() is called with the #GtkMenuItem as the
	 * second argument. The #GtkAccelLabel will now display “Ctrl+S” after its label.
	 * 
	 * Note that creating a #GtkMenuItem with gtk_menu_item_new_with_label() (or
	 * one of the similar functions for #GtkCheckMenuItem and #GtkRadioMenuItem)
	 * automatically adds a #GtkAccelLabel to the #GtkMenuItem and calls
	 * gtk_accel_label_set_accel_widget() to set it up for you.
	 * 
	 * A #GtkAccelLabel will only display accelerators which have %GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE
	 * set (see #GtkAccelFlags).
	 * A #GtkAccelLabel can display multiple accelerators and even signal names,
	 * though it is almost always used to display just one accelerator key.

	 * 
	 * An accelerator is uniquely defined by:
	 * - accelerator path
	 * - accelerator key
	 * - accelerator modifiers
	 * 
	 * The accelerator path must consist of
	 * “<WINDOWTYPE>/Category1/Category2/.../Action”, where WINDOWTYPE
	 * should be a unique application-specific identifier that corresponds
	 * to the kind of window the accelerator is being used in, e.g.
	 * “Gimp-Image”, “Abiword-Document” or “Gnumeric-Settings”.
	 * The “Category1/.../Action” portion is most appropriately chosen by
	 * the action the accelerator triggers, i.e. for accelerators on menu
	 * items, choose the item’s menu path, e.g. “File/Save As”,
	 * “Image/View/Zoom” or “Edit/Select All”. So a full valid accelerator
	 * path may look like: “<Gimp-Toolbox>/File/Dialogs/Tool Options...”.
	 * 
	 * All accelerators are stored inside one global #GtkAccelMap that can
	 * be obtained using {@link Gtk.AccelMap.get}. See
	 * [Monitoring changes][monitoring-changes] for additional
	 * details.

	 *

	 * To search for specific accelerator, use gtk_accel_map_lookup_entry().
	 * Modifications of existing accelerators should be done using
	 * gtk_accel_map_change_entry().
	 * 
	 * In order to avoid having some accelerators changed, they can be

	 * 
	 * All actions that would make sense to use in a particular context
	 * should be in a single group. Multiple action groups may be used for a
	 * particular user interface. In fact, it is expected that most nontrivial
	 * applications will make use of multiple groups. For example, in an
	 * application that can edit multiple documents, one group holding global
	 * actions (e.g. quit, about, new), and one group per document holding
	 * actions that act on that document (eg. save, cut/copy/paste, etc). Each
	 * window’s menus would be constructed from a combination of two action
	 * groups.
	 * 
	 * ## Accelerators ## {#Action-Accel}
	 * 
	 * Accelerators are handled by the GTK+ accelerator map. All actions are
	 * assigned an accelerator path (which normally has the form
	 * `<Actions>/group-name/action-name`) and a shortcut is associated with
	 * this accelerator path. All menuitems and toolitems take on this accelerator
	 * path. The GTK+ accelerator map code makes sure that the correct shortcut
	 * is displayed next to the menu item.
	 * 
	 * # GtkActionGroup as GtkBuildable # {#GtkActionGroup-BUILDER-UI}
	 * 
	 * The #GtkActionGroup implementation of the #GtkBuildable interface accepts
	 * #GtkAction objects as `<child>` elements in UI definitions.
	 * 
	 * Note that it is probably more common to define actions and action groups
	 * in the code, since they are directly related to what the code can do.
	 * 
	 * The GtkActionGroup implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports
	 * a custom `<accelerator>` element, which has attributes named “key“ and
	 * “modifiers“ and allows to specify accelerators. This is similar to the
	 * `<accelerator>` element of #GtkWidget, the main difference is that

	/**
	 * {@link Application} is a class that handles many important aspects
	 * of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
	 * a one-size-fits-all application model.
	 * 
	 * Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK+ initialization, application
	 * uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
	 * desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
	 * list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
	 * life-cycle of your application.
	 * 
	 * While GtkApplication works fine with plain #GtkWindows, it is recommended
	 * to use it together with #GtkApplicationWindow.
	 * 
	 * When GDK threads are enabled, GtkApplication will acquire the GDK
	 * lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes.  The GDK
	 * lock is not touched for local action invocations.  In order to have
	 * actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
	 * that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
	 * {@link G.action_group_activate_action}.  The same applies to actions
	 * associated with #GtkApplicationWindow and to the “activate” and
	 * “open” #GApplication methods.
	 * 
	 * ## Automatic resources ## {#automatic-resources}
	 * 
	 * #GtkApplication will automatically load menus from the #GtkBuilder
	 * resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
	 * resource base path (see g_application_set_resource_base_path()).  The
	 * menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
	 * and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
	 * menubar.  Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
	 * and accessed via gtk_application_get_menu_by_id() which allows for
	 * dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
	 * 
	 * If the resources "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
	 * present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the value
	 * of gtk_application_prefers_app_menu(). If the resource "gtk/menus-common.ui"
	 * is present it will be loaded as well. This is useful for storing items that
	 * are referenced from both "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" and
	 * "gtk/menus-traditional.ui".
	 * 
	 * It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
	 * gtk_application_set_app_menu() and gtk_application_set_menubar().
	 * 
	 * #GtkApplication will also automatically setup an icon search path for
	 * the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
	 * path.  This allows your application to easily store its icons as
	 * resources.  See gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path() for more
	 * information.
	 * 
	 * If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
	 * defines a #GtkShortcutsWindow with ID "help_overlay" then GtkApplication
	 * associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
	 * #GtkApplicationWindow and sets up keyboard accelerators (Control-F1
	 * and Control-?) to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
	 * shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.
	 * 
	 * ## A simple application ## {#gtkapplication}
	 * 
	 * [A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
	 * 
	 * GtkApplication optionally registers with a session manager
	 * of the users session (if you set the #GtkApplication:register-session
	 * property) and offers various functionality related to the session
	 * life-cycle.
	 * 
	 * An application can block various ways to end the session with
	 * the gtk_application_inhibit() function. Typical use cases for
	 * this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
	 * such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
	 * manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
	 * inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
	 * session while inhibitors are present.
	 *

	 * features.  Notably, it can handle both the application menu as well
	 * as the menubar. See {@link Gtk.Application.set_app_menu} and
	 * gtk_application_set_menubar().
	 * 
	 * This class implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap interfaces,
	 * to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
	 * associated #GtkApplication, together with its application-wide
	 * actions.  Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
	 * prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
	 * prefix.  Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
	 * referring to them from a #GMenuModel.
	 * 
	 * Note that widgets that are placed inside a #GtkApplicationWindow
	 * can also activate these actions, if they implement the
	 * #GtkActionable interface.
	 * 
	 * As with #GtkApplication, the GDK lock will be acquired when
	 * processing actions arriving from other processes and should therefore
	 * be held when activating actions locally (if GDK threads are enabled).
	 * 
	 * The settings #GtkSettings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu and
	 * #GtkSettings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar tell GTK+ whether the
	 * desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
	 * models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
	 * For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
	 * on Windows neither will be. gnome-shell (starting with version 3.4)
	 * will display the application menu, but not the menubar.
	 * 
	 * If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
	 * #GtkApplicationWindow will automatically show a #GtkMenuBar for it.
	 * This behaviour can be overridden with the #GtkApplicationWindow:show-menubar
	 * property. If the desktop environment does not display the application
	 * menu, then it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the
	 * windows client-side decorations.

	 * 
	 * [A simple example](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/examples/sunny.c)
	 * 
	 * The XML format understood by #GtkBuilder for #GMenuModel consists
	 * of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
	 * elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
	 * elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
	 * same content model as `<menu>`. Instead of `<link name="submenu>` or
	 * `<link name="section">`, you can use `<submenu>` or `<section>`
	 * elements.
	 * 
	 * Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other #GtkBuilder
	 * content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
	 * `translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
	 * context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
	 * To make use of this, the #GtkBuilder must have been given the gettext
	 * domain to use.
	 * 
	 * The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:
	 * - "label": a user-visible string to display
	 * - "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
	 * - "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
	 * - "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
	 * - "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to determine
	 *      if a submenu can be opened
	 * - "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
	 *      Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".
	 * 
	 * The following attributes are used when constructing sections:
	 * - "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
	 * - "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
	 *     Possible values include "horizontal-buttons".
	 * - "text-direction": a string used to determine the #GtkTextDirection to use
	 *     when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
	 *     include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".
	 * 
	 * The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:
	 * - "label": a user-visible string to display

	 * A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
	 * of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
	 * a GtkBuilder from a user interface description, call
	 * {@link Gtk.Builder.new_from_file}, gtk_builder_new_from_resource() or
	 * gtk_builder_new_from_string().
	 * 
	 * In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
	 * descriptions from multiple sources to the same GtkBuilder you can
	 * call gtk_builder_new() to get an empty builder and populate it by
	 * (multiple) calls to gtk_builder_add_from_file(),
	 * gtk_builder_add_from_resource() or gtk_builder_add_from_string().
	 * 
	 * A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
	 * and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
	 * cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
	 * contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
	 * builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call gtk_widget_destroy()
	 * to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.
	 * 
	 * The functions gtk_builder_get_object() and gtk_builder_get_objects()
	 * can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
	 * to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
	 * functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
	 * with gtk_widget_destroy(). Other widgets will either be part of a
	 * larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
	 * not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
	 * case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
	 * Non-widget objects need to be reffed with g_object_ref() to keep them
	 * beyond the lifespan of the builder.
	 * 
	 * The function gtk_builder_connect_signals() and variants thereof can be
	 * used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
	 * 
	 * # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # {#BUILDER-UI}
	 * 
	 * GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
	 * specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
	 * RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
	 * UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
	 * Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI Definitions with
	 * [GtkUIManager UI Definitions][XML-UI], which are more limited in scope.
	 * It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
	 * GtkBuilder UI definitions.
	 * 
	 * [RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
	 * 
	 * The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
	 * attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
	 * using dgettext() in the domain specified. This can also be done by
	 * calling gtk_builder_set_translation_domain() on the builder.
	 * Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
	 * `<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
	 * connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
	 * child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
	 * actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A `<child>`
	 * element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
	 * The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
	 * the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
	 * the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
	 * the target version in the form `<major>.<minor>`. The builder will error
	 * out if the version requirements are not met.
	 * 
	 * Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
	 * element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
	 * been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
	 * class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
	 * necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the get_type() function
	 * explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder
	 * allows to use an object that has been constructed by a {@link UIManager} in
	 * another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the #GtkUIManager
	 * in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
	 * attribute.
	 * 
	 * Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
	 * application to retrieve them from the builder with gtk_builder_get_object().
	 * An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
	 * parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
	 * with `___` (3 underscores) for its own purposes.
	 * 
	 * Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
	 * `<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
	 * property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
	 * If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
	 * gettext() (or dgettext() if the builder has a translation domain set)
	 * to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
	 * is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
	 * probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
	 * specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
	 * may help the translators.
	 * 
	 * GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common
	 * property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
	 * booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
	 * as %TRUE, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
	 * as %FALSE), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
	 * integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
	 * value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
	 * and colors (in a format understood by gdk_rgba_parse()).
	 * 
	 * GVariants can be specified in the format understood by g_variant_parse(),
	 * and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
	 * 
	 * Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
	 * objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
	 * gtk_builder_expose_object(). In general, GtkBuilder allows forward
	 * references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
	 * have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
	 * to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
	 * be used as the value of a construct-only property.
	 * 
	 * It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
	 * property value using the attributes
	 * "bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
	 * "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
	 * "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags.
	 * Internally builder implements this using GBinding objects.
	 * For more information see g_object_bind_property()
	 * 
	 * Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
	 * attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
	 * specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
	 * to find the handler using g_module_symbol(), but this can be changed by
	 * passing a custom #GtkBuilderConnectFunc to
	 * gtk_builder_connect_signals_full(). The remaining attributes, “after”,
	 * “swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
	 * parameters of the g_signal_connect_object() or
	 * g_signal_connect_data() functions. A “last_modification_time”
	 * attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
	 * builder.
	 * 
	 * Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
	 * been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
	 * properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the #vbox of
	 * a #GtkDialog). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
	 * property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder
	 * still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
	 * has already been constructed.
	 * 
	 * A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
	 * (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
	 * a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
	 * The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
	 * sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.

	 * The {@link CellArea} is an abstract class for #GtkCellLayout widgets
	 * (also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with an
	 * arbitrary number of #GtkCellRenderers and interact with the user
	 * for a given #GtkTreeModel row.
	 * 
	 * The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
	 * size requests and allocations for a given row of data.
	 * 
	 * Usually users dont have to interact with the #GtkCellArea directly
	 * unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.
	 * 
	 * # Requesting area sizes
	 * 
	 * As outlined in
	 * [GtkWidget’s geometry management section][geometry-management],
	 * GTK+ uses a height-for-width
	 * geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
	 * interfaces. #GtkCellArea uses the same semantics to calculate the
	 * size of an area for an arbitrary number of #GtkTreeModel rows.
	 * 
	 * When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
	 * the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
	 * different layouting widgets. For instance a #GtkTreeViewColumn
	 * always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a #GtkIconView
	 * on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
	 * width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
	 * areas when allocated less width.
	 * 
	 * It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
	 * alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
	 * appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
	 * cells are different in each row). For this reason the #GtkCellArea
	 * uses a #GtkCellAreaContext object to store the alignments
	 * and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
	 * and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
	 * with the said context).
	 * 
	 * The #GtkCellAreaContext is an opaque object specific to the
	 * #GtkCellArea which created it (see {@link Gtk.CellArea.create_context}).
	 * The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
	 * it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
	 * same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
	 * However, it’s important that the same #GtkCellAreaContext which
	 * was used to request the sizes for a given #GtkTreeModel row be
	 * used when rendering or processing events for that row.
	 * 
	 * In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
	 * of a #GtkTreeModel one would do the following:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GtkTreeIter iter;
	 * gint        minimum_width;
	 * gint        natural_width;
	 * 
	 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
	 * while (valid)
	 *   {
	 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
	 *     gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);
	 * 
	 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
	 *   }
	 * gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
	 * returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
	 * unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
	 * widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
	 * in the accompanying #GtkCellAreaContext object and can be consulted
	 * at any time.
	 * 
	 * This can be useful since #GtkCellLayout widgets usually have to
	 * support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
	 * exceedingly large amount of rows. The #GtkCellLayout widget in
	 * that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
	 * idle or timeout source (see g_timeout_add()) and when the widget
	 * is requested its actual width in #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width()
	 * it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
	 * #GtkCellAreaContext object.
	 * 
	 * A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
	 * take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget       *widget,
	 *                          gint            *minimum_size,
	 *                          gint            *natural_size)
	 * {
	 *   Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
	 *   FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
	 * 
	 *   foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (foo);
	 * 
	 *   gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * In the above example the Foo widget has to make sure that some
	 * row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that Foo judged
	 * was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
	 * before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
	 * the #GtkCellAreaContext.
	 * 
	 * Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
	 * a similar task except in this case the #GtkCellAreaContext does not
	 * store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
	 * widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
	 * widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
	 * width which was requested by the #GtkCellArea).
	 * 
	 * In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
	 * root level of a #GtkTreeModel one would do the following:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GtkTreeIter iter;
	 * gint        minimum_height;
	 * gint        natural_height;
	 * gint        full_minimum_height = 0;
	 * gint        full_natural_height = 0;
	 * 
	 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
	 * while (valid)
	 *   {
	 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
	 *     gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
	 *                                                   width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);
	 * 
	 *     if (width_is_for_allocation)
	 *        cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);
	 * 
	 *     full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
	 *     full_natural_height += natural_height;
	 * 
	 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
	 *   }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
	 * returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
	 * areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
	 * heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
	 * allocation.
	 * 
	 * In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
	 * arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
	 * who need to request size for tens of thousands  of rows. For this
	 * case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
	 * one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
	 * synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
	 * at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
	 * the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
	 * call to #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width(). Returning
	 * a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
	 * inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
	 * from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
	 * values while more and more height is required for the row heights
	 * that are calculated in the background.
	 * 
	 * # Rendering Areas
	 * 
	 * Once area sizes have been aquired at least for the rows in the
	 * visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
	 * #GtkWidgetClass.draw() time.
	 * 
	 * A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
	 * runs as follows:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GtkAllocation allocation;
	 * GdkRectangle  cell_area = { 0, };
	 * GtkTreeIter   iter;
	 * gint          minimum_width;
	 * gint          natural_width;
	 * 
	 * gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
	 * cell_area.width = allocation.width;
	 * 
	 * valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
	 * while (valid)
	 *   {
	 *     cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);
	 * 
	 *     gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
	 *     gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
	 *                           &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);
	 * 
	 *     cell_area.y += cell_area.height;
	 * 
	 *     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
	 *   }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
	 * the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
	 * give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
	 * is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
	 * would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
	 * #GtkWidget::size-allocate time using gtk_distribute_natural_allocation().
	 * 
	 * # Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus
	 * 
	 * Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
	 * normal widget and then passing them to the gtk_cell_area_event()
	 * API as they come in. Usually #GtkCellArea is only interested in
	 * button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
	 * who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
	 * trigger the #GtkCellArea::focus-changed signal to fire; as well as
	 * #GtkCellArea::add-editable in the case that an editable cell was
	 * clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
	 * gtk_cell_area_stop_editing() at any time to cancel any cell editing
	 * that is currently in progress.
	 * 
	 * The #GtkCellArea drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
	 * similar to #GtkWidget. For layouting widgets that support giving
	 * focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass %GTK_CELL_RENDERER_FOCUSED
	 * to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
	 * area to paint the focus at render time.
	 * 
	 * Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
	 * #GtkWidgetClass.focus() virtual method. The layouting widget is always
	 * responsible for knowing where #GtkTreeModel rows are rendered inside
	 * the widget, so at #GtkWidgetClass.focus() time the layouting widget
	 * should use the #GtkCellArea methods to navigate focus inside the area
	 * and then observe the GtkDirectionType to pass the focus to adjacent
	 * rows and areas.
	 * 
	 * A basic example of how the #GtkWidgetClass.focus() virtual method
	 * should be implemented:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static gboolean
	 * foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
	 *            GtkDirectionType direction)
	 * {
	 *   Foo        *foo  = FOO (widget);
	 *   FooPrivate *priv = foo->priv;
	 *   gint        focus_row;
	 *   gboolean    have_focus = FALSE;
	 * 
	 *   focus_row = priv->focus_row;
	 * 
	 *   if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
	 *     gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);
	 * 
	 *   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
	 *   while (valid)
	 *     {
	 *       gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
	 * 
	 *       if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
	 *         {
	 *            priv->focus_row = focus_row;
	 *            have_focus = TRUE;
	 *            break;
	 *         }
	 *       else
	 *         {
	 *           if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
	 *               direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)

	 *                 break;
	 *               else

	 *                }
	 *             }
	 *           else
	 *             {
	 *               if (focus_row == last_row)
	 *                 break;
	 *               else

	 *                   valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);

	 * specific way.  It is worth noting that #GtkCellRenderer is not a
	 * #GtkWidget and cannot be treated as such.
	 * 
	 * The primary use of a #GtkCellRenderer is for drawing a certain graphical
	 * elements on a #cairo_t. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
	 * draw many cells on the screen.  To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
	 * CellRenderer keep any permanent state around.  Instead, any state is set
	 * just prior to use using #GObjects property system.  Then, the
	 * cell is measured using {@link Gtk.CellRenderer.get_size}. Finally, the cell
	 * is rendered in the correct location using gtk_cell_renderer_render().
	 * 
	 * There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
	 * #GtkCellRenderer.  First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
	 * of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
	 * barring a #GtkStyle change.  The #GtkCellRenderer also has a number of
	 * generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.
	 * 
	 * Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
	 * provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
	 * “activatable” like #GtkCellRendererToggle,
	 * which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
	 * “editable” like #GtkCellRendererText, which
	 * allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
	 * #GtkCellEditable interface, e.g. #GtkEntry.
	 * To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
	 * implement the #GtkCellRendererClass.activate or
	 * #GtkCellRendererClass.start_editing virtual functions, respectively.
	 * 
	 * Many properties of #GtkCellRenderer and its subclasses have a
	 * corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
	 * to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
	 * has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

	/**
	 * The {@link Clipboard} object represents a clipboard of data shared
	 * between different processes or between different widgets in
	 * the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
	 * #GdkAtom. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
	 * {@link Gdk.atom.intern} and gdk_atom_name().) The default clipboard
	 * corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard
	 * is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
	 * the currently selected text.
	 * 
	 * To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
	 * at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
	 * callbacks instead of the actual data.  When you set the contents
	 * of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
	 * functions like gtk_clipboard_set_text()), or you can supply a
	 * callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
	 * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() or gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner().)
	 * Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
	 * when it is not needed.
	 * 
	 * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() and gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner()
	 * are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
	 * which is more convenient in a particular situation.
	 * The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
	 * with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
	 * advertise. When the #clear_func you provided is called, you
	 * simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
	 * contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a #GObject
	 * (As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
	 * provides the clipboard’s contents the contents are simply the
	 * text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
	 * entry widget can call gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner() to update
	 * the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
	 * about #clear_func being called.
	 * 
	 * Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
	 * asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
	 * the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
	 * retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
	 * then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
	 * may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
	 * to request the selection, gtk_clipboard_request_contents() takes a
	 * callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
	 * when the request fails.) If you don’t want to deal with providing
	 * a separate callback, you can also use gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents().
	 * What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
	 * the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
	 * to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
	 * while this recursive mainloop is running.
	 * 
	 * Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
	 * arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
	 * it as text, gtk_clipboard_request_text() and
	 * gtk_clipboard_wait_for_text(). These functions take care of
	 * determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
	 * provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
	 * and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
	 * form for representing strings in GTK+.)

	 * A GtkComboBox is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
	 * valid choices. The GtkComboBox displays the selected choice. When
	 * activated, the GtkComboBox displays a popup which allows the user to
	 * make a new choice. The style in which the selected value is displayed,
	 * and the style of the popup is determined by the current theme. It may
	 * be similar to a Windows-style combo box.
	 * 
	 * The GtkComboBox uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
	 * is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
	 * can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
	 * would in a tree view. This is possible since GtkComboBox implements the
	 * {@link CellLayout} interface. The tree model holding the valid choices is
	 * not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the popup will
	 * reflect the tree structure.
	 * 
	 * To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the “has-entry”
	 * property allows the GtkComboBox to contain a #GtkEntry. This entry
	 * can be accessed by calling {@link Gtk.Bin.get_child} on the combo box.
	 * 
	 * For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of GtkComboBox
	 * can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, #GtkComboBoxText offers a
	 * simple alternative. Both GtkComboBox and #GtkComboBoxText can contain
	 * an entry.

	/**
	 * A GTK+ user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets.
	 * Container widgets are the inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets:
	 * they contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a {@link Window}
	 * containing a #GtkFrame containing a #GtkLabel. If you wanted an image instead
	 * of a textual label inside the frame, you might replace the #GtkLabel widget
	 * with a #GtkImage widget.
	 * 
	 * There are two major kinds of container widgets in GTK+. Both are subclasses
	 * of the abstract GtkContainer base class.
	 * 
	 * The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives
	 * from #GtkBin. These containers are decorators, which
	 * add some kind of functionality to the child. For example, a #GtkButton makes
	 * its child into a clickable button; a #GtkFrame draws a frame around its child
	 * and a #GtkWindow places its child widget inside a top-level window.
	 * 
	 * The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is to
	 * manage layout. This means that these containers assign
	 * sizes and positions to their children. For example, a #GtkHBox arranges its
	 * children in a horizontal row, and a #GtkGrid arranges the widgets it contains
	 * in a two-dimensional grid.
	 * 
	 * For implementations of #GtkContainer the virtual method #GtkContainerClass.forall()
	 * is always required, since it's used for drawing and other internal operations
	 * on the children.
	 * If the #GtkContainer implementation expect to have non internal children
	 * it's needed to implement both #GtkContainerClass.add() and #GtkContainerClass.remove().
	 * If the GtkContainer implementation has internal children, they should be added
	 * with gtk_widget_set_parent() on init() and removed with gtk_widget_unparent()
	 * in the #GtkWidgetClass.destroy() implementation.
	 * See more about implementing custom widgets at https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/CustomWidgets
	 * 
	 * # Height for width geometry management
	 * 
	 * GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management system.
	 * Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much vertical space it needs,
	 * depending on the amount of horizontal space that it is given (and similar for
	 * width-for-height).
	 * 
	 * There are some things to keep in mind when implementing container widgets
	 * that make use of GTK+’s height for width geometry management system. First,
	 * it’s important to note that a container must prioritize one of its
	 * dimensions, that is to say that a widget or container can only have a
	 * #GtkSizeRequestMode that is %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH or
	 * %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_WIDTH_FOR_HEIGHT. However, every widget and container
	 * must be able to respond to the APIs for both dimensions, i.e. even if a
	 * widget has a request mode that is height-for-width, it is possible that
	 * its parent will request its sizes using the width-for-height APIs.
	 * 
	 * To ensure that everything works properly, here are some guidelines to follow
	 * when implementing height-for-width (or width-for-height) containers.
	 * 
	 * Each request mode involves 2 virtual methods. Height-for-width apis run
	 * through gtk_widget_get_preferred_width() and then through gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width().
	 * When handling requests in the opposite #GtkSizeRequestMode it is important that
	 * every widget request at least enough space to display all of its content at all times.
	 * 
	 * When gtk_widget_get_preferred_height() is called on a container that is height-for-width,
	 * the container must return the height for its minimum width. This is easily achieved by
	 * simply calling the reverse apis implemented for itself as follows:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_container_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
	 *                                     gint *min_height,
	 *                                     gint *nat_height)
	 * {
	 *    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
	 *      {
	 *        gint min_width;
	 * 
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
	 *                                                            &min_width,
	 *                                                            NULL);
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
	 *                                                           (widget,
	 *                                                            min_width,
	 *                                                            min_height,
	 *                                                            nat_height);
	 *      }
	 *    else
	 *      {
	 *        ... many containers support both request modes, execute the
	 *        real width-for-height request here by returning the
	 *        collective heights of all widgets that are stacked
	 *        vertically (or whatever is appropriate for this container)
	 *        ...
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Similarly, when gtk_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height() is called for a container or widget
	 * that is height-for-width, it then only needs to return the base minimum width like so:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_container_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
	 *                                               gint for_height,
	 *                                               gint *min_width,
	 *                                               gint *nat_width)
	 * {
	 *    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
	 *      {
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
	 *                                                            min_width,
	 *                                                            nat_width);
	 *      }
	 *    else
	 *      {
	 *        ... execute the real width-for-height request here based on
	 *        the required width of the children collectively if the
	 *        container were to be allocated the said height ...
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Height for width requests are generally implemented in terms of a virtual allocation
	 * of widgets in the input orientation. Assuming an height-for-width request mode, a container
	 * would implement the get_preferred_height_for_width() virtual function by first calling
	 * gtk_widget_get_preferred_width() for each of its children.
	 * 
	 * For each potential group of children that are lined up horizontally, the values returned by
	 * gtk_widget_get_preferred_width() should be collected in an array of #GtkRequestedSize structures.
	 * Any child spacing should be removed from the input #for_width and then the collective size should be
	 * allocated using the gtk_distribute_natural_allocation() convenience function.
	 * 
	 * The container will then move on to request the preferred height for each child by using
	 * gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width() and using the sizes stored in the #GtkRequestedSize array.
	 * 
	 * To allocate a height-for-width container, it’s again important
	 * to consider that a container must prioritize one dimension over the other. So if
	 * a container is a height-for-width container it must first allocate all widgets horizontally
	 * using a #GtkRequestedSize array and gtk_distribute_natural_allocation() and then add any
	 * extra space (if and where appropriate) for the widget to expand.
	 * 
	 * After adding all the expand space, the container assumes it was allocated sufficient
	 * height to fit all of its content. At this time, the container must use the total horizontal sizes
	 * of each widget to request the height-for-width of each of its children and store the requests in a
	 * #GtkRequestedSize array for any widgets that stack vertically (for tabular containers this can
	 * be generalized into the heights and widths of rows and columns).
	 * The vertical space must then again be distributed using gtk_distribute_natural_allocation()
	 * while this time considering the allocated height of the widget minus any vertical spacing
	 * that the container adds. Then vertical expand space should be added where appropriate and available
	 * and the container should go on to actually allocating the child widgets.
	 * 
	 * See [GtkWidget’s geometry management section][geometry-management]
	 * to learn more about implementing height-for-width geometry management for widgets.
	 * 
	 * # Child properties
	 * 
	 * GtkContainer introduces child properties.
	 * These are object properties that are not specific
	 * to either the container or the contained widget, but rather to their relation.
	 * Typical examples of child properties are the position or pack-type of a widget
	 * which is contained in a #GtkBox.
	 * 
	 * Use gtk_container_class_install_child_property() to install child properties
	 * for a container class and gtk_container_class_find_child_property() or
	 * gtk_container_class_list_child_properties() to get information about existing
	 * child properties.
	 * 
	 * To set the value of a child property, use gtk_container_child_set_property(),
	 * gtk_container_child_set() or gtk_container_child_set_valist().
	 * To obtain the value of a child property, use
	 * gtk_container_child_get_property(), gtk_container_child_get() or
	 * gtk_container_child_get_valist(). To emit notification about child property
	 * changes, use gtk_widget_child_notify().
	 * 
	 * # GtkContainer as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkContainer implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports
	 * a `<packing>` element for children, which can contain multiple `<property>`
	 * elements that specify child properties for the child.
	 * 
	 * Since 2.16, child properties can also be marked as translatable using
	 * the same “translatable”, “comments” and “context” attributes that are used
	 * for regular properties.
	 * 
	 * Since 3.16, containers can have a `<focus-chain>` element containing multiple
	 * `<widget>` elements, one for each child that should be added to the focus
	 * chain. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.
	 * 
	 * An example of these properties in UI definitions:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkBox">
	 *   <child>
	 *     <object class="GtkEntry" id="entry1"/>
	 *     <packing>
	 *       <property name="pack-type">start</property>
	 *     </packing>
	 *   </child>
	 *   <child>
	 *     <object class="GtkEntry" id="entry2"/>
	 *   </child>
	 *   <focus-chain>
	 *     <widget name="entry1"/>
	 *     <widget name="entry2"/>
	 *   </focus-chain>
	 * </object>

	 * Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
	 * of input, e.g. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
	 * that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.
	 * 
	 * GTK+ treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a
	 * {@link VBox}, and is where widgets such as a #GtkLabel or a #GtkEntry should
	 * be packed. The bottom area is known as the
	 * “action area”. This is generally used for
	 * packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as
	 * cancel, ok, or apply.
	 * 
	 * #GtkDialog boxes are created with a call to {@link Gtk.Dialog.new} or
	 * gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons(). gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons() is
	 * recommended; it allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient
	 * flags, and add simple buttons.
	 * 
	 * If “dialog” is a newly created dialog, the two primary areas of the
	 * window can be accessed through gtk_dialog_get_content_area() and
	 * gtk_dialog_get_action_area(), as can be seen from the example below.
	 * 
	 * A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
	 * from user input), can be created by calling gtk_window_set_modal() on the
	 * dialog. Use the GTK_WINDOW() macro to cast the widget returned from
	 * gtk_dialog_new() into a #GtkWindow. When using gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons()
	 * you can also pass the #GTK_DIALOG_MODAL flag to make a dialog modal.
	 * 
	 * If you add buttons to #GtkDialog using gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons(),
	 * gtk_dialog_add_button(), gtk_dialog_add_buttons(), or
	 * gtk_dialog_add_action_widget(), clicking the button will emit a signal
	 * called #GtkDialog::response with a response ID that you specified. GTK+
	 * will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely
	 * user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the
	 * #GtkResponseType enumeration (these all have values less than zero). If
	 * a dialog receives a delete event, the #GtkDialog::response signal will
	 * be emitted with a response ID of #GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT.
	 * 
	 * If you want to block waiting for a dialog to return before returning
	 * control flow to your code, you can call gtk_dialog_run(). This function
	 * enters a recursive main loop and waits for the user to respond to the
	 * dialog, returning the response ID corresponding to the button the user
	 * clicked.
	 * 
	 * For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you’d probably
	 * use #GtkMessageDialog to save yourself some effort. But you’d need to
	 * create the dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message
	 * in the dialog.
	 * 
	 * An example for simple GtkDialog usage:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * // Function to open a dialog box with a message
	 * void
	 * quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, gchar *message)
	 * {
	 *  GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
	 *  GtkDialogFlags flags;
	 * 
	 *  // Create the widgets
	 *  flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
	 *  dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
	 *                                        parent,
	 *                                        flags,
	 *                                        _("_OK"),
	 *                                        GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
	 *                                        NULL);
	 *  content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
	 *  label = gtk_label_new (message);
	 * 
	 *  // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds
	 * 
	 *  g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
	 *                            "response",
	 *                            G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy),
	 *                            dialog);
	 * 
	 *  // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added
	 * 
	 *  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (content_area), label);
	 *  gtk_widget_show_all (dialog);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # GtkDialog as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkDialog implementation of the #GtkBuildable interface exposes the
	 * #vbox and #action_area as internal children with the names “vbox” and
	 * “action_area”.
	 * 
	 * GtkDialog supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
	 * multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
	 * numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
	 * (which should be a child of the dialogs #action_area). To mark a response
	 * as default, set the “default“ attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
	 * to true.
	 * 
	 * GtkDialog supports adding action widgets by specifying “action“ as
	 * the “type“ attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
	 * either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
	 * on the “use-header-bar“ property. The response id has to be associated
	 * with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.
	 * 
	 * An example of a #GtkDialog UI definition fragment:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
	 *   <child type="action">
	 *     <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>

	 *     <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>

	/**
	 * The {@link Entry} widget is a single line text entry
	 * widget. A fairly large set of key bindings are supported
	 * by default. If the entered text is longer than the allocation
	 * of the widget, the widget will scroll so that the cursor
	 * position is visible.
	 * 
	 * When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
	 * it can be put into “password mode” using {@link Gtk.Entry.set_visibility}.
	 * In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
	 * By default, GTK+ picks the best invisible character that is available
	 * in the current font, but it can be changed with
	 * gtk_entry_set_invisible_char(). Since 2.16, GTK+ displays a warning
	 * when Caps Lock or input methods might interfere with entering text in
	 * a password entry. The warning can be turned off with the
	 * #GtkEntry:caps-lock-warning property.
	 * 
	 * Since 2.16, GtkEntry has the ability to display progress or activity
	 * information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
	 * use gtk_entry_set_progress_fraction() or gtk_entry_set_progress_pulse_step().
	 * 
	 * Additionally, GtkEntry can show icons at either side of the entry. These
	 * icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source and
	 * can have tooltips. To add an icon, use gtk_entry_set_icon_from_gicon() or
	 * one of the various other functions that set an icon from a stock id, an
	 * icon name or a pixbuf. To trigger an action when the user clicks an icon,
	 * connect to the #GtkEntry::icon-press signal. To allow DND operations
	 * from an icon, use gtk_entry_set_icon_drag_source(). To set a tooltip on
	 * an icon, use gtk_entry_set_icon_tooltip_text() or the corresponding function
	 * for markup.
	 * 
	 * Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
	 * on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
	 * able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
	 * that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
	 * via the context menu of the entry.

	 * GtkEntry has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties
	 * of the entry, the style classes .read-only and .flat may appear. The style
	 * classes .warning and .error may also be used with entries.
	 * 
	 * When the entry shows icons, it adds subnodes with the name image and the
	 * style class .left or .right, depending on where the icon appears.
	 * 
	 * When the entry has a selection, it adds a subnode with the name selection.
	 * 
	 * When the entry shows progress, it adds a subnode with the name progress.
	 * The node has the style class .pulse when the shown progress is pulsing.
	 * 
	 * The CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode below entry as well.
	 * 
	 * The undershoot nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content
	 * is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the .left and .right style classes
	 * added depending on where the indication is drawn.
	 * 
	 * When touch is used and touch selection handles are shown, they are using
	 * CSS nodes with name cursor-handle. They get the .top or .bottom style class
	 * depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If there is
	 * just a single handle for the text cursor, it gets the style class
	 * .insertion-cursor.

	 * 
	 * “Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
	 * in the entry, #GtkEntryCompletion checks which rows in the model match
	 * the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
	 * By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
	 * case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
	 * {@link Gtk.EntryCompletion.set_text_column}), but this can be overridden
	 * with a custom match function (see gtk_entry_completion_set_match_func()).
	 * 
	 * When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
	 * updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
	 * text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
	 * to the #GtkEntryCompletion::match-selected signal and updating the
	 * entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return %TRUE from
	 * the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.
	 * 
	 * To add completion functionality to an entry, use gtk_entry_set_completion().
	 * 
	 * In addition to regular completion matches, which will be inserted into the
	 * entry when they are selected, #GtkEntryCompletion also allows to display
	 * “actions” in the popup window. Their appearance is similar to menuitems,
	 * to differentiate them clearly from completion strings. When an action is
	 * selected, the #GtkEntryCompletion::action-activated signal is emitted.
	 * 
	 * GtkEntryCompletion uses a #GtkTreeModelFilter model to represent the
	 * subset of the entire model that is currently matching. While the
	 * GtkEntryCompletion signals #GtkEntryCompletion::match-selected and
	 * #GtkEntryCompletion::cursor-on-match take the original model and an

		 *

	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * ## Setting up a file chooser dialog ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-setting-up}
	 * 
	 * There are various cases in which you may need to use a #GtkFileChooserDialog:
	 * 
	 * - To select a file for opening. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN.
	 * 
	 * - To save a file for the first time. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
	 *   and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with {@link Gtk.FileChooser.set_current_name}.
	 * 
	 * - To save a file under a different name. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE,
	 *   and set the existing filename with gtk_file_chooser_set_filename().
	 * 
	 * - To choose a folder instead of a file. Use #GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER.
	 * 
	 * Note that old versions of the file chooser’s documentation suggested
	 * using gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder() in various
	 * situations, with the intention of letting the application
	 * suggest a reasonable default folder.  This is no longer
	 * considered to be a good policy, as now the file chooser is
	 * able to make good suggestions on its own.  In general, you
	 * should only cause the file chooser to show a specific folder
	 * when it is appropriate to use gtk_file_chooser_set_filename(),
	 * i.e. when you are doing a Save As command and you already
	 * have a file saved somewhere.
	 * 
	 * ## Response Codes ## {#gtkfilechooserdialog-responses}
	 * 
	 * #GtkFileChooserDialog inherits from #GtkDialog, so buttons that
	 * go in its action area have response codes such as
	 * #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT and #GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL.  For example, you
	 * could call gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new() as follows:
	 * 
	 * |[
	 * GtkWidget *dialog;
	 * GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
	 * 
	 * dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
	 *                                       parent_window,
	 *                                       action,
	 *                                       _("_Cancel"),
	 *                                       GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
	 *                                       _("_Open"),
	 *                                       GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
	 *                                       NULL);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use stock
	 * response identifiers from #GtkResponseType.  For most dialog
	 * boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
	 * ones in #GtkResponseType, but #GtkFileChooserDialog assumes that
	 * its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
	 * will have one of the following response codes:
	 * 
	 * - #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT
	 * - #GTK_RESPONSE_OK
	 * - #GTK_RESPONSE_YES
	 * - #GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY
	 * 
	 * This is because #GtkFileChooserDialog must intercept responses
	 * and switch to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the
	 * dialog terminate — the implementation uses these known
	 * response codes to know which responses can be blocked if
	 * appropriate.
	 * 
	 * To summarize, make sure you use a
	 * [stock response code][gtkfilechooserdialog-responses]
	 * when you use #GtkFileChooserDialog to ensure proper operation.

	 * 
	 * ## Differences from #GtkFileChooserDialog ##  {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-differences}
	 * 
	 * There are a few things in the GtkFileChooser API that are not
	 * possible to use with #GtkFileChooserNative, as such use would
	 * prohibit the use of a native dialog.
	 * 
	 * There is no support for the signals that are emitted when the user
	 * navigates in the dialog, including:
	 * * #GtkFileChooser::current-folder-changed
	 * * #GtkFileChooser::selection-changed
	 * * #GtkFileChooser::file-activated
	 * * #GtkFileChooser::confirm-overwrite
	 * 
	 * You can also not use the methods that directly control user navigation:
	 * * {@link Gtk.FileChooser.unselect_filename}
	 * * gtk_file_chooser_select_all()
	 * * gtk_file_chooser_unselect_all()
	 * 
	 * If you need any of the above you will have to use #GtkFileChooserDialog directly.
	 * 
	 * No operations that change the the dialog work while the dialog is
	 * visible. Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.
	 * 
	 * ## Win32 details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-win32}
	 * 
	 * On windows the IFileDialog implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
	 * used. It supports many of the features that #GtkFileChooserDialog
	 * does, but there are some things it does not handle:
	 * 
	 * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
	 * 
	 * * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
	 * 
	 * * Any #GtkFileFilter added using a mimetype or custom filter.
	 * 
	 * If any of these features are used the regular #GtkFileChooserDialog
	 * will be used in place of the native one.
	 * 
	 * ## Portal details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-portal}
	 * 
	 * When the org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser portal is available on the
	 * session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser. Depending
	 * on the kind of session the application is running in, this may or may not
	 * be a GTK+ file chooser. In this situation, the following things are not
	 * supported and will be silently ignored:
	 * 
	 * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
	 * 
	 * * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
	 * 
	 * * Any #GtkFileFilter added with a custom filter.
	 * 
	 * ## macOS details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-macos}
	 * 
	 * On macOS the NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel classes are used to provide native
	 * file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by #GtkFileChooserDialog are
	 * not supported:
	 * 
	 * * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget(), unless the
	 *   widget is an instance of GtkLabel, in which case the label text will be used

	 * 
	 * For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
	 * you from having to learn about the other GTK+ containers, but it
	 * results in broken applications.  With #GtkFixed, the following
	 * things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
	 * other display bugs:
	 * 
	 * - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
	 * 
	 * - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
	 *   change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
	 *   users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
	 *   default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
	 * 
	 * - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
	 *   display of non-English text will use a different font in many
	 *   cases.
	 * 
	 * In addition, #GtkFixed does not pay attention to text direction and thus may
	 * produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left languages
	 * such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK+ will order containers
	 * appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to the right of the
	 * thing they label when using an RTL language, but it can’t do that with
	 * #GtkFixed. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on the text direction,
	 * you would need to manually detect it and adjust child positions accordingly.
	 * 
	 * Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
	 * GUI elements, since you have to reposition all the other
	 * elements. This is a long-term maintenance problem for your
	 * application.
	 * 
	 * If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
	 * and prefer the simplicity of #GtkFixed, by all means use the
	 * widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.

	/**
	 * {@link GLArea} is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL.
	 * 
	 * #GtkGLArea sets up its own #GdkGLContext for the window it creates, and
	 * creates a custom GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto.
	 * It also ensures that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target
	 * when rendering.
	 * 
	 * In order to draw, you have to connect to the #GtkGLArea::render signal,
	 * or subclass #GtkGLArea and override the #GtkGLAreaClass.render() virtual
	 * function.
	 * 
	 * The #GtkGLArea widget ensures that the #GdkGLContext is associated with
	 * the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
	 * position of the drawing area changes.
	 * 
	 * ## Drawing with GtkGLArea ##
	 * 
	 * The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a #GtkGLArea is to
	 * create a widget instance and connect to the #GtkGLArea::render signal:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   // create a GtkGLArea instance
	 *   GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();
	 * 
	 *   // connect to the "render" signal
	 *   g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * The `render()` function will be called when the #GtkGLArea is ready
	 * for you to draw its content:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   static gboolean
	 *   render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
	 *   {
	 *     // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
	 *     // #GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
	 *     // surface used by the #GtkGLArea and the viewport has
	 *     // already been set to be the size of the allocation
	 * 
	 *     // we can start by clearing the buffer
	 *     glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
	 *     glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
	 * 
	 *     // draw your object
	 *     draw_an_object ();
	 * 
	 *     // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
	 *     // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
	 *     // the buffers will be drawn on the window
	 *     return TRUE;
	 *   }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
	 * shaders, you should use the #GtkWidget::realize signal; you
	 * can use the #GtkWidget::unrealize signal to clean up. Since the
	 * #GdkGLContext creation and initialization may fail, you will
	 * need to check for errors, using gtk_gl_area_get_error(). An example
	 * of how to safely initialize the GL state is:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   static void
	 *   on_realize (GtkGLarea *area)
	 *   {
	 *     // We need to make the context current if we want to
	 *     // call GL API
	 *     gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);
	 * 
	 *     // If there were errors during the initialization or
	 *     // when trying to make the context current, this
	 *     // function will return a #GError for you to catch
	 *     if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
	 *       return;
	 * 
	 *     // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order
	 *     // to show eventual initialization errors on the
	 *     // GtkGLArea widget itself
	 *     GError *internal_error = NULL;
	 *     init_buffer_objects (&error);
	 *     if (error != NULL)
	 *       {
	 *         gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
	 *         g_error_free (error);
	 *         return;
	 *       }
	 * 
	 *     init_shaders (&error);
	 *     if (error != NULL)
	 *       {
	 *         gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
	 *         g_error_free (error);
	 *         return;
	 *       }
	 *   }
	 * ]|
	 *

	/** This construct is only for enabling class multi-inheritance,

	type GestureMixin = IGesture & EventController;

	/**
	 * {@link Gesture} is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
	 * object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
	 * it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
	 * the special %NULL #GdkEventSequence value for these).
	 * 
	 * The number of touches that a #GtkGesture need to be recognized is controlled
	 * by the #GtkGesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
	 * or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
	 * is recognized.
	 * 
	 * As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
	 * run the #GtkGesture::check signal regularly on input events until the gesture
	 * is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
	 * #GtkGesture subclasses.
	 * 
	 * A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
	 * - #GtkGesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
	 * - A number of #GtkGesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
	 * - #GtkGesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
	 * 
	 * ## Event propagation
	 * 
	 * In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
	 * through {@link Gtk.EventController.set_propagation_phase}, or feed those manually
	 * through gtk_event_controller_handle_event().
	 * 
	 * In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
	 * target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
	 * get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
	 * 
	 * After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional #GtkWidget::button-press-event,
	 * #GtkWidget::button-release-event, #GtkWidget::touch-event, etc signals. Gestures
	 * with the %GTK_PHASE_TARGET phase are fed events from the default #GtkWidget::event
	 * handlers.
	 * 
	 * In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
	 * toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
	 * a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
	 * 
	 * ## States of a sequence # {#touch-sequence-states}
	 * 
	 * Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
	 * #GtkGestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
	 * in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
	 * widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
	 * in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the #GdkEventSequences
	 * triggering those.
	 * 
	 * Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through gtk_gesture_group(),
	 * grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
	 * gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state() on one will effectively propagate
	 * the state throughout the group.
	 * 
	 * By default, all sequences start out in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
	 * sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
	 * propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
	 * 
	 * If a sequence enters into the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
	 * group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
	 * through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
	 * the touch is active.
	 * 
	 * If a sequence enters in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
	 * group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
	 * - Setting the same sequence to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other gesture
	 *   group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
	 *   chain.
	 * - calling #GtkGesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
	 *   propagation chain.
	 * - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
	 * 
	 * Note: if a sequence is set early to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
	 * #GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/#GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
	 * reaching the event widget, this implies #GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
	 * event will emulated if the sequence changes to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
	 * This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
	 * again.
	 * 
	 * Sequence states can't be changed freely, see gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()
	 * to know about the possible lifetimes of a #GdkEventSequence.
	 * 
	 * ## Touchpad gestures
	 * 
	 * On the platforms that support it, #GtkGesture will handle transparently
	 * touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of #GtkGesture should do
	 * to enable this support are:
	 * - Enabling %GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK on their #GdkWindows
	 * - If the gesture has %GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
	 *   %GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and %GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the #GtkGesture

	/**
	 * {@link IMContext} defines the interface for GTK+ input methods. An input method
	 * is used by GTK+ text input widgets like #GtkEntry to map from key events to
	 * Unicode character strings.
	 * 
	 * The default input method can be set programmatically via the
	 * #GtkSettings:gtk-im-module GtkSettings property. Alternatively, you may set
	 * the GTK_IM_MODULE environment variable as documented in
	 * [Running GTK+ Applications][gtk-running].
	 * 
	 * The #GtkEntry #GtkEntry:im-module and #GtkTextView #GtkTextView:im-module
	 * properties may also be used to set input methods for specific widget
	 * instances. For instance, a certain entry widget might be expected to contain
	 * certain characters which would be easier to input with a certain input
	 * method.
	 * 
	 * An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence and finally
	 * output the composed result. This is called preediting, and an input method
	 * may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
	 * composition states as preedit text. For instance, the default GTK+ input
	 * method implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down
	 * the Control and Shift keys and then typing “U” followed by the hexadecimal
	 * digits of the code point.  When releasing the Control and Shift keys,
	 * preediting ends and the character is inserted as text. Ctrl+Shift+u20AC for
	 * example results in the € sign.
	 * 
	 * Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK+ widgets as
	 * loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
	 * implements a subclass of #GtkIMContext or #GtkIMContextSimple and exports
	 * these four functions:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * void im_module_init(GTypeModule *module);
	 * ]|
	 * This function should register the #GType of the #GtkIMContext subclass which
	 * implements the input method by means of {@link G.type_module_register_type}. Note
	 * that g_type_register_static() cannot be used as the type needs to be
	 * registered dynamically.
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * void im_module_exit(void);
	 * ]|
	 * Here goes any cleanup code your input method might require on module unload.
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * void im_module_list(const GtkIMContextInfo ***contexts, int *n_contexts)
	 * {
	 *   *contexts = info_list;
	 *   *n_contexts = G_N_ELEMENTS (info_list);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * This function returns the list of input methods provided by the module. The
	 * example implementation above shows a common solution and simply returns a
	 * pointer to statically defined array of #GtkIMContextInfo items for each
	 * provided input method.
	 *

	/**
	 * {@link IconTheme} provides a facility for looking up icons by name
	 * and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
	 * providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
	 * depending on what “icon theme” is selected
	 * by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
	 * follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
	 * There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
	 * should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
	 * as operating system vendors and users choose.
	 * 
	 * Named icons are similar to the deprecated [Stock Items][gtkstock],
	 * and the distinction between the two may be a bit confusing.
	 * A few things to keep in mind:
	 * 
	 * - Stock images usually are used in conjunction with
	 *   [Stock Items][gtkstock], such as %GTK_STOCK_OK or
	 *   %GTK_STOCK_OPEN. Named icons are easier to set up and therefore
	 *   are more useful for new icons that an application wants to
	 *   add, such as application icons or window icons.
	 * 
	 * - Stock images can only be loaded at the symbolic sizes defined
	 *   by the #GtkIconSize enumeration, or by custom sizes defined
	 *   by {@link Gtk.icon.size_register}, while named icons are more flexible
	 *   and any pixel size can be specified.
	 * 
	 * - Because stock images are closely tied to stock items, and thus
	 *   to actions in the user interface, stock images may come in
	 *   multiple variants for different widget states or writing
	 *   directions.
	 * 
	 * A good rule of thumb is that if there is a stock image for what
	 * you want to use, use it, otherwise use a named icon. It turns
	 * out that internally stock images are generally defined in
	 * terms of one or more named icons. (An example of the
	 * more than one case is icons that depend on writing direction;
	 * %GTK_STOCK_GO_FORWARD uses the two themed icons
	 * “gtk-stock-go-forward-ltr” and “gtk-stock-go-forward-rtl”.)
	 * 
	 * In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via #GtkImage
	 * or stock items, rather than directly, but looking up icons
	 * directly is also simple. The #GtkIconTheme object acts
	 * as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
	 * can create new #GtkIconTheme objects, but it’s much more
	 * efficient to use the standard icon theme for the #GdkScreen
	 * so that the icon information is shared with other people
	 * looking up icons.

	 * ]|
	 * If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a
	 * “broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
	 * If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
	 * for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
	 * gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file(), then create the #GtkImage with
	 * gtk_image_new_from_pixbuf().
	 * 
	 * The image file may contain an animation, if so the #GtkImage will
	 * display an animation (#GdkPixbufAnimation) instead of a static image.

	 * align it (center, left, right) and add padding to it, using

	 * 
	 * When handling events on the event box, keep in mind that coordinates

	 * the alignment and padding settings on the image (see #GtkMisc).
	 * The simplest way to solve this is to set the alignment to 0.0
	 * (left/top), and set the padding to zero. Then the origin of
	 * the image will be the same as the origin of the event box.
	 * 
	 * Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
	 * files, such as image files. GTK+ comes with a program to avoid this,
	 * called “gdk-pixbuf-csource”. This library
	 * allows you to convert an image into a C variable declaration, which
	 * can then be loaded into a #GdkPixbuf using
	 * gdk_pixbuf_new_from_inline().
	 *

	 * {@link InfoBar} is a widget that can be used to show messages to
	 * the user without showing a dialog. It is often temporarily shown
	 * at the top or bottom of a document. In contrast to #GtkDialog, which
	 * has a action area at the bottom, #GtkInfoBar has an action area
	 * at the side.
	 * 
	 * The API of #GtkInfoBar is very similar to #GtkDialog, allowing you
	 * to add buttons to the action area with {@link Gtk.InfoBar.add_button} or
	 * gtk_info_bar_new_with_buttons(). The sensitivity of action widgets
	 * can be controlled with gtk_info_bar_set_response_sensitive().
	 * To add widgets to the main content area of a #GtkInfoBar, use
	 * gtk_info_bar_get_content_area() and add your widgets to the container.
	 * 
	 * Similar to #GtkMessageDialog, the contents of a #GtkInfoBar can by
	 * classified as error message, warning, informational message, etc,
	 * by using gtk_info_bar_set_message_type(). GTK+ may use the message type
	 * to determine how the message is displayed.
	 * 
	 * A simple example for using a #GtkInfoBar:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->

	 * GtkWidget *grid;
	 * GtkInfoBar *bar;

	 * g_signal_connect (bar,
	 *                   "response",
	 *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_hide),

	 * 
	 * The GtkInfoBar implementation of the GtkBuildable interface exposes
	 * the content area and action area as internal children with the names
	 * “content_area” and “action_area”.
	 * 
	 * GtkInfoBar supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
	 * multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
	 * numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
	 * (which should be a child of the dialogs #action_area).
	 * 
	 * # CSS nodes
	 * 
	 * GtkInfoBar has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get
	 * one of the style classes .info, .warning, .error or .question, depending

	/**
	 * The {@link Label} widget displays a small amount of text. As the name
	 * implies, most labels are used to label another widget such as a
	 * #GtkButton, a #GtkMenuItem, or a #GtkComboBox.
	 * 
	 * # CSS nodes
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
	 * label
	 * ├── [selection]
	 * ├── [link]
	 * ┊
	 * ╰── [link]
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * GtkLabel has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
	 * of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
	 * .dim-label, etc. In the #GtkShortcutsWindow, labels are used wth the
	 * .keycap style class.
	 * 
	 * If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.
	 * 
	 * If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
	 * carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
	 * visited.
	 * 
	 * # GtkLabel as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkLabel implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
	 * custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
	 * elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
	 * “start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify #PangoAttribute values for
	 * this label.
	 * 
	 * An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkLabel">
	 *   <attributes>
	 *     <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
	 *     <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
	 *   </attributes>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
	 * Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute is
	 * applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
	 * sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
	 * content instead.
	 * 
	 * # Mnemonics
	 * 
	 * Labels may contain “mnemonics”. Mnemonics are
	 * underlined characters in the label, used for keyboard navigation.
	 * Mnemonics are created by providing a string with an underscore before
	 * the mnemonic character, such as `"_File"`, to the
	 * functions {@link Gtk.Label.new_with_mnemonic} or
	 * gtk_label_set_text_with_mnemonic().
	 * 
	 * Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is
	 * inside, such as a #GtkButton; if the label is not inside the
	 * mnemonic’s target widget, you have to tell the label about the target
	 * using gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget(). Here’s a simple example where
	 * the label is inside a button:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
	 *   GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
	 *   GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
	 *   gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (button), label);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
	 * already inside:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
	 *   GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
	 * #GtkEntry, you have to point the label at the entry with
	 * gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget():
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
	 *   GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
	 *   GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
	 *   gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # Markup (styled text)
	 * 
	 * To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
	 * fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
	 * [markup format][PangoMarkupFormat].
	 * 
	 * Here’s how to create a label with a small font:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
	 *   gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * (See [complete documentation][PangoMarkupFormat] of available
	 * tags in the Pango manual.)
	 * 
	 * The markup passed to gtk_label_set_markup() must be valid; for example,
	 * literal <, > and & characters must be escaped as &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.
	 * If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
	 * gtk_label_set_markup(), you’ll want to escape it with
	 * g_markup_escape_text() or g_markup_printf_escaped().
	 * 
	 * Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the #PangoAttrList on
	 * a label; gtk_label_set_attributes() may be a simpler way to set
	 * attributes in some cases. Be careful though; #PangoAttrList tends to
	 * cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
	 * to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
	 * to [0, %G_MAXINT)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
	 * end_index for a #PangoAttribute requires knowledge of the exact string
	 * being displayed, so translations will cause problems.
	 * 
	 * # Selectable labels
	 * 
	 * Labels can be made selectable with gtk_label_set_selectable().
	 * Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
	 * the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information
	 * — such as error messages — should be made selectable.
	 * 
	 * # Text layout # {#label-text-layout}
	 * 
	 * A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
	 * performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
	 * Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
	 * understood by Pango.
	 * 
	 * Labels can automatically wrap text if you call
	 * gtk_label_set_line_wrap().
	 * 
	 * gtk_label_set_justify() sets how the lines in a label align
	 * with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole
	 * aligns in its available space, see the #GtkWidget:halign and
	 * #GtkWidget:valign properties.
	 * 
	 * The #GtkLabel:width-chars and #GtkLabel:max-width-chars properties
	 * can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or wrapped
	 * labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
	 * than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
	 * text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
	 * width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
	 * is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
	 * labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.
	 * 
	 * Note that the interpretation of #GtkLabel:width-chars and
	 * #GtkLabel:max-width-chars has changed a bit with the introduction of
	 * [width-for-height geometry management.][geometry-management]
	 * 
	 * # Links
	 * 
	 * Since 2.18, GTK+ supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition
	 * to regular Pango markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML,
	 * using the `<a>` with “href“ and “title“ attributes. GTK+ renders links
	 * similar to the way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined
	 * text. The “title“ attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link.
	 * 
	 * An example looks like this:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * const gchar *text =
	 * "Go to the"
	 * "<a href=\"http://www.gtk.org title=\"&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
	 * "GTK+ website</a> for more...";
	 * GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
	 * gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips with
	 * the #GtkLabel::activate-link signal and the gtk_label_get_current_uri() function.

	 * data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer).  Columns that
	 * accept #GObjects are handled a little differently.  The
	 * #GtkListStore will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
	 * value.  As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
	 * application writer to call {@link Gtk.TreeModel.row_changed} to emit the
	 * #GtkTreeModel::row_changed signal.  This most commonly affects lists with
	 * #GdkPixbufs stored.
	 * 
	 * An example for creating a simple list store:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * enum {
	 *   COLUMN_STRING,
	 *   COLUMN_INT,
	 *   COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
	 *   N_COLUMNS
	 * };
	 * 
	 * {
	 *   GtkListStore *list_store;
	 *   GtkTreePath *path;
	 *   GtkTreeIter iter;
	 *   gint i;
	 * 
	 *   list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
	 *                                    G_TYPE_STRING,
	 *                                    G_TYPE_INT,
	 *                                    G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);
	 * 
	 *   for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
	 *     {
	 *       gchar *some_data;
	 * 
	 *       some_data = get_some_data (i);
	 * 
	 *       // Add a new row to the model
	 *       gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
	 *       gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
	 *                           COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
	 *                           COLUMN_INT, i,
	 *                           COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
	 *                           -1);
	 * 
	 *       // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
	 *       // we free some_data.
	 *       g_free (some_data);
	 *     }
	 * 
	 *   // Modify a particular row
	 *   path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
	 *   gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),

	 *                            path);
	 *   gtk_tree_path_free (path);
	 *   gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
	 *                       COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,

	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # Performance Considerations
	 * 
	 * Internally, the #GtkListStore was implemented with a linked list with
	 * a tail pointer prior to GTK+ 2.6.  As a result, it was fast at data
	 * insertion and deletion, and not fast at random data access.  The
	 * #GtkListStore sets the #GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag, which means
	 * that #GtkTreeIters can be cached while the row exists.  Thus, if
	 * access to a particular row is needed often and your code is expected to
	 * run on older versions of GTK+, it is worth keeping the iter around.
	 * 
	 * # Atomic Operations
	 * 
	 * It is important to note that only the methods
	 * gtk_list_store_insert_with_values() and gtk_list_store_insert_with_valuesv()
	 * are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
	 * values filled in in a single operation with regard to #GtkTreeModel signaling.
	 * In contrast, using e.g. gtk_list_store_append() and then gtk_list_store_set()
	 * will first create a row, which triggers the #GtkTreeModel::row-inserted signal
	 * on #GtkListStore. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
	 * connecting to #GtkTreeModel::row-inserted on this particular store should be prepared
	 * for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
	 * if you are wrapping the #GtkListStore inside a #GtkTreeModelFilter and are
	 * using a #GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc. Using any of the non-atomic operations
	 * to append rows to the #GtkListStore will cause the
	 * #GtkTreeModelFilterVisibleFunc to be visited with an empty row first; the
	 * function must be prepared for that.
	 * 
	 * # GtkListStore as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkListStore implementation of the GtkBuildable interface allows
	 * to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
	 * multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
	 * attribute specifies the data type for the column.
	 * 
	 * Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
	 * in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
	 * `<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
	 * Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.
	 * 
	 * Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
	 * and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
	 * a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
	 * is to separate the two, as far as possible.
	 * 
	 * An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkListStore">
	 *   <columns>
	 *     <column type="gchararray"/>
	 *     <column type="gchararray"/>
	 *     <column type="gint"/>
	 *   </columns>
	 *   <data>
	 *     <row>
	 *       <col id="0">John</col>
	 *       <col id="1">Doe</col>
	 *       <col id="2">25</col>
	 *     </row>
	 *     <row>
	 *       <col id="0">Johan</col>
	 *       <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
	 *       <col id="2">50</col>
	 *     </row>
	 *   </data>
	 * </object>

	 * GtkPrintOperation is the high-level, portable printing API.
	 * It looks a bit different than other GTK+ dialogs such as the
	 * {@link FileChooser}, since some platforms don’t expose enough
	 * infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such
	 * platforms, GtkPrintOperation uses the native print dialog.
	 * On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK+
	 * uses its own, see #GtkPrintUnixDialog.
	 * 
	 * The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create
	 * a GtkPrintOperation object with {@link Gtk.PrintOperation.new} when
	 * the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it,
	 * e.g. the page size, any #GtkPrintSettings from previous print
	 * operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.
	 * 
	 * Then you start the print operation by calling gtk_print_operation_run().
	 * It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and
	 * options. When the user finished the dialog various signals will
	 * be emitted on the #GtkPrintOperation, the main one being
	 * #GtkPrintOperation::draw-page, which you are supposed to catch
	 * and render the page on the provided #GtkPrintContext using Cairo.

	 * The {@link ProgressBar} is typically used to display the progress of a long

	 * The GtkProgressBar can be used in two different modes: percentage mode
	 * and activity mode.
	 * 
	 * When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
	 * (e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
	 * progress, it can use the GtkProgressBar in percentage mode and the
	 * user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
	 * has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
	 * {@link Gtk.ProgressBar.set_fraction} periodically to update the progress bar.
	 * 
	 * When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
	 * to do, it can use the #GtkProgressBar in activity mode, which shows
	 * activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
	 * this mode, the application is required to call gtk_progress_bar_pulse()
	 * periodically to update the progress bar.
	 * 
	 * There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
	 * of the #GtkProgressBar. Functions are provided to control the orientation
	 * of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
	 * step size used in activity mode can be set.

	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->

	 * doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
	 * your own scrolling with #GtkScrollbar and for example a #GtkGrid.
	 * 
	 * # Touch support
	 * 
	 * GtkScrolledWindow has built-in support for touch devices. When a
	 * touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
	 * expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
	 * #GtkScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling property if it is undesired.
	 * 
	 * GtkScrolledWindow also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
	 * the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
	 * captured with the #GtkScrolledWindow::edge-overshot signal.
	 * 
	 * If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlayed as
	 * narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
	 * scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
	 * can be turned off with the #GtkScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling
	 * property.
	 * 
	 * # CSS nodes
	 * 
	 * GtkScrolledWindow has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
	 * 
	 * It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to
	 * draw the overflow and underflow indications. These nodes get
	 * the .left, .right, .top or .bottom style class added depending
	 * on where the indication is drawn.
	 * 
	 * GtkScrolledWindow also sets the positional style classes (.left,
	 * .right, .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay
	 * scrolling (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.
	 * 
	 * If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn
	 * with a subnode named junction.

	 * GtkSettings provide a mechanism to share global settings between
	 * applications.
	 * 
	 * On the X window system, this sharing is realized by an
	 * [XSettings](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/xsettings-spec)
	 * manager that is usually part of the desktop environment, along with
	 * utilities that let the user change these settings. In the absence of
	 * an Xsettings manager, GTK+ reads default values for settings from
	 * `settings.ini` files in
	 * `/etc/gtk-3.0`, `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gtk-3.0`
	 * and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0`.
	 * These files must be valid key files (see #GKeyFile), and have
	 * a section called Settings. Themes can also provide default values
	 * for settings by installing a `settings.ini` file
	 * next to their `gtk.css` file.
	 * 
	 * Applications can override system-wide settings by setting the property
	 * of the GtkSettings object with {@link GObject.set}. This should be restricted
	 * to special cases though; GtkSettings are not meant as an application
	 * configuration facility. When doing so, you need to be aware that settings
	 * that are specific to individual widgets may not be available before the
	 * widget type has been realized at least once. The following example
	 * demonstrates a way to do this:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 *   gtk_init (&argc, &argv);
	 * 
	 *   // make sure the type is realized
	 *   g_type_class_unref (g_type_class_ref (GTK_TYPE_IMAGE_MENU_ITEM));
	 * 
	 *   g_object_set (gtk_settings_get_default (), "gtk-enable-animations", FALSE, NULL);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * There is one GtkSettings instance per screen. It can be obtained with
	 * gtk_settings_get_for_screen(), but in many cases, it is more convenient
	 * to use gtk_widget_get_settings(). gtk_settings_get_default() returns the
	 * GtkSettings instance for the default screen.

	/**
	 * {@link SizeGroup} provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets
	 * together so they all request the same amount of space.  This is
	 * typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same
	 * size, but you can’t use a #GtkGrid widget.
	 * 
	 * In detail, the size requested for each widget in a #GtkSizeGroup is
	 * the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
	 * widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
	 * of the size group (see {@link Gtk.SizeGroup.set_mode}) determines whether
	 * this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.
	 * 
	 * Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
	 * the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
	 * a #GtkSizeGroup to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
	 * such a way that they get the size they request and not more. For
	 * example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
	 * include the %GTK_FILL flag.
	 * 
	 * #GtkSizeGroup objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
	 * so once you have added all widgets to a #GtkSizeGroup, you can drop
	 * the initial reference to the size group with g_object_unref(). If the
	 * widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
	 * be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
	 * group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
	 * freed.
	 * 
	 * Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK+ will compute the
	 * horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
	 * widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
	 * of type %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL or %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_BOTH, and the
	 * vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
	 * reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
	 * %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_VERTICAL or %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_BOTH.
	 * 
	 * Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
	 * by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
	 * will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
	 * a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
	 * trade height for width in mode %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_VERTICAL or %GTK_SIZE_GROUP_BOTH:
	 * the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
	 * widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
	 * width for height widgets.
	 * 
	 * Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum width
	 * by way of #GtkLabel:width-chars for instance. Widgets with static sizes as well
	 * as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no such considerations.
	 * 
	 * # GtkSizeGroup as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
	 * element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
	 * widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
	 * that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
	 * size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

	/**
	 * Together with {@link Plug}, #GtkSocket provides the ability to embed
	 * widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that
	 * is transparent to the user. One process creates a #GtkSocket widget
	 * and passes that widget’s window ID to the other process, which then
	 * creates a #GtkPlug with that window ID. Any widgets contained in the
	 * #GtkPlug then will appear inside the first application’s window.
	 * 
	 * The socket’s window ID is obtained by using {@link Gtk.Socket.get_id}.
	 * Before using this function, the socket must have been realized,
	 * and for hence, have been added to its parent.
	 * 
	 * ## Obtaining the window ID of a socket.
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GtkWidget *socket = gtk_socket_new ();
	 * gtk_widget_show (socket);
	 * gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (parent), socket);
	 * 
	 * // The following call is only necessary if one of
	 * // the ancestors of the socket is not yet visible.
	 * gtk_widget_realize (socket);
	 * g_print ("The ID of the sockets window is %#x\n",
	 *          gtk_socket_get_id (socket));
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Note that if you pass the window ID of the socket to another
	 * process that will create a plug in the socket, you must make
	 * sure that the socket widget is not destroyed until that plug
	 * is created. Violating this rule will cause unpredictable
	 * consequences, the most likely consequence being that the plug
	 * will appear as a separate toplevel window. You can check if
	 * the plug has been created by using gtk_socket_get_plug_window().
	 * If it returns a non-%NULL value, then the plug has been
	 * successfully created inside of the socket.
	 * 
	 * When GTK+ is notified that the embedded window has been destroyed,
	 * then it will destroy the socket as well. You should always,
	 * therefore, be prepared for your sockets to be destroyed at any
	 * time when the main event loop is running. To prevent this from
	 * happening, you can connect to the #GtkSocket::plug-removed signal.
	 * 
	 * The communication between a #GtkSocket and a #GtkPlug follows the
	 * [XEmbed Protocol](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/xembed-spec).
	 * This protocol has also been implemented in other toolkits, e.g. Qt,
	 * allowing the same level of integration when embedding a Qt widget
	 * in GTK or vice versa.
	 * 
	 * The #GtkPlug and #GtkSocket widgets are only available when GTK+
	 * is compiled for the X11 platform and %GDK_WINDOWING_X11 is defined.
	 * They can only be used on a #GdkX11Display. To use #GtkPlug and
	 * #GtkSocket, you need to include the `gtk/gtkx.h` header.

	 * The “system tray” or notification area is normally used for transient icons
	 * that indicate some special state. For example, a system tray icon might
	 * appear to tell the user that they have new mail, or have an incoming instant
	 * message, or something along those lines. The basic idea is that creating an
	 * icon in the notification area is less annoying than popping up a dialog.
	 * 
	 * A {@link StatusIcon} object can be used to display an icon in a “system tray”.
	 * The icon can have a tooltip, and the user can interact with it by
	 * activating it or popping up a context menu.
	 * 
	 * It is very important to notice that status icons depend on the existence
	 * of a notification area being available to the user; you should not use status
	 * icons as the only way to convey critical information regarding your application,
	 * as the notification area may not exist on the user's environment, or may have
	 * been removed. You should always check that a status icon has been embedded into
	 * a notification area by using {@link Gtk.StatusIcon.is_embedded}, and gracefully
	 * recover if the function returns %FALSE.
	 * 
	 * On X11, the implementation follows the
	 * [FreeDesktop System Tray Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/systemtray-spec).
	 * Implementations of the “tray” side of this specification can
	 * be found e.g. in the GNOME 2 and KDE panel applications.
	 * 
	 * Note that a GtkStatusIcon is not a widget, but just a #GObject. Making it a
	 * widget would be impractical, since the system tray on Windows doesn’t allow
	 * to embed arbitrary widgets.
	 * 
	 * GtkStatusIcon has been deprecated in 3.14. You should consider using
	 * notifications or more modern platform-specific APIs instead. GLib provides
	 * the #GNotification API which works well with #GtkApplication on multiple
	 * platforms and environments, and should be the preferred mechanism to notify
	 * the users of transient status updates. See this [HowDoI](https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GNotification)
	 * for code examples.

	/**
	 * A {@link TreeModelFilter} is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
	 * and can do the following things:
	 * 
	 * - Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
	 *   storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
	 *   or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
	 *   model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
	 *   row should be filtered or not.
	 * 
	 * - Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
	 *   This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
	 *   values and also for creating a completely different model based
	 *   on the given child model.
	 * 
	 * - Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
	 *   in a #GtkTreePath indicating the root node for the filter at construction
	 *   time.
	 * 
	 * The basic API is similar to #GtkTreeModelSort. For an example on its usage,
	 * see the section on #GtkTreeModelSort.
	 * 
	 * When using #GtkTreeModelFilter, it is important to realize that
	 * #GtkTreeModelFilter maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
	 * visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
	 * exposed by the child model. #GtkTreeModelFilter will not cache the entire
	 * child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
	 * that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
	 * implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
	 * because of reference counting rule 3, see the #GtkTreeModel
	 * documentation. (Note that e.g. #GtkTreeStore does not implement
	 * reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
	 * the receiving node is not visible).
	 * 
	 * Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
	 * In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
	 * the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
	 * or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
	 * node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
	 * When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
	 * nodes (see reference couting rule number 3 in the #GtkTreeModel section).
	 * 
	 * Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
	 * of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
	 * #GtkTreeModelFilter explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
	 * does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
	 * As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
	 * last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
	 * 
	 * This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
	 * to accommodate this, #GtkTreeModelFilter must make sure the necessary
	 * signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
	 * for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to #GtkTreeModelFilter's
	 * clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
	 * in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
	 * row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
	 * was not cached), #GtkTreeModelFilter will check if the visibility state
	 * of any parent node has changed.
	 * 
	 * Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
	 * cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
	 * in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
	 * own. In this case, either rely on #GtkTreeStore to emit all signals
	 * because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
	 * do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
	 * yourself.

	 * That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
	 * methods on the #GtkTreeView widget instead of a separate function.
	 * 
	 * The #GtkTreeSelection object is gotten from a #GtkTreeView by calling
	 * {@link Gtk.TreeView.get_selection}.  It can be manipulated to check the
	 * selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
	 * rows.  Selection is done completely view side.  As a result, multiple
	 * views of the same model can have completely different selections.
	 * Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
	 * is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
	 * first.
	 * 
	 * One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
	 * a view is that the #GtkTreeSelection::changed signal is mostly a hint.
	 * That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
	 * Additionally, it may on occasion emit a #GtkTreeSelection::changed signal
	 * when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling

	 * 
	 * Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the GtkTreeView API.
	 * These are:

	 * ![](tree-view-coordinates.png)
	 * 
	 * Coordinate systems in GtkTreeView API:
	 * 
	 * - Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).
	 * 
	 * - Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that GtkTreeView renders to.
	 * 
	 * - Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of GtkTreeView. These
	 *   coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.
	 * 
	 * Several functions are available for converting between the different
	 * coordinate systems.  The most common translations are between widget and bin
	 * window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
	 * former you can use {@link Gtk.TreeView.convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords}

	 * (and vice versa).

	 * There are some additional restrictions beyond those specified in the

	 * a #GMarkupParser is used to parse the UI description, it must not only
	 * be valid XML, but valid markup.
	 * 
	 * If a name is not specified, it defaults to the action. If an action is
	 * not specified either, the element name is used. The name and action
	 * attributes must not contain “/” characters after parsing (since that
	 * would mess up path lookup) and must be usable as XML attributes when
	 * enclosed in doublequotes, thus they must not “"” characters or references
	 * to the &quot; entity.

	 * 
	 * The constructed widget hierarchy is very similar to the element tree
	 * of the XML, with the exception that placeholders are merged into their
	 * parents. The correspondence of XML elements to widgets should be
	 * almost obvious:
	 * 
	 * - menubar
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkMenuBar
	 * 
	 * - toolbar
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkToolbar
	 * 
	 * - popup
	 * 
	 *    a toplevel #GtkMenu
	 * 
	 * - menu
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkMenu attached to a menuitem
	 * 
	 * - menuitem
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkMenuItem subclass, the exact type depends on the action
	 * 
	 * - toolitem
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkToolItem subclass, the exact type depends on the
	 *    action. Note that toolitem elements may contain a menu element,
	 *    but only if their associated action specifies a
	 *    #GtkMenuToolButton as proxy.
	 * 
	 * - separator
	 * 
	 *    a #GtkSeparatorMenuItem or #GtkSeparatorToolItem
	 * 
	 * - accelerator
	 * 
	 *    a keyboard accelerator
	 * 
	 * The “position” attribute determines where a constructed widget is positioned
	 * wrt. to its siblings in the partially constructed tree. If it is
	 * “top”, the widget is prepended, otherwise it is appended.
	 * 
	 * # UI Merging # {#UI-Merging}
	 * 
	 * The most remarkable feature of #GtkUIManager is that it can overlay a set
	 * of menuitems and toolitems over another one, and demerge them later.
	 * 
	 * Merging is done based on the names of the XML elements. Each element is
	 * identified by a path which consists of the names of its anchestors, separated
	 * by slashes. For example, the menuitem named “Left” in the example above
	 * has the path `/ui/menubar/JustifyMenu/Left` and the
	 * toolitem with the same name has path
	 * `/ui/toolbar1/JustifyToolItems/Left`.
	 * 
	 * # Accelerators #
	 * 
	 * Every action has an accelerator path. Accelerators are installed together
	 * with menuitem proxies, but they can also be explicitly added with
	 * `<accelerator>` elements in the UI definition. This makes it possible to
	 * have accelerators for actions even if they have no visible proxies.
	 * 
	 * # Smart Separators # {#Smart-Separators}
	 * 
	 * The separators created by #GtkUIManager are “smart”, i.e. they do not show up
	 * in the UI unless they end up between two visible menu or tool items. Separators
	 * which are located at the very beginning or end of the menu or toolbar
	 * containing them, or multiple separators next to each other, are hidden. This
	 * is a useful feature, since the merging of UI elements from multiple sources
	 * can make it hard or impossible to determine in advance whether a separator
	 * will end up in such an unfortunate position.
	 * 
	 * For separators in toolbars, you can set `expand="true"` to
	 * turn them from a small, visible separator to an expanding, invisible one.
	 * Toolitems following an expanding separator are effectively right-aligned.
	 * 
	 * # Empty Menus
	 * 
	 * Submenus pose similar problems to separators inconnection with merging. It is
	 * impossible to know in advance whether they will end up empty after merging.
	 * #GtkUIManager offers two ways to treat empty submenus:
	 * 
	 * - make them disappear by hiding the menu item they’re attached to
	 * 
	 * - add an insensitive “Empty” item
	 * 
	 * The behaviour is chosen based on the “hide_if_empty” property of the action
	 * to which the submenu is associated.
	 * 
	 * # GtkUIManager as GtkBuildable # {#GtkUIManager-BUILDER-UI}
	 * 
	 * The GtkUIManager implementation of the GtkBuildable interface accepts
	 * GtkActionGroup objects as `<child>` elements in UI definitions.
	 * 
	 * A GtkUIManager UI definition as described above can be embedded in
	 * an GtkUIManager `<object>` element in a GtkBuilder UI definition.
	 * 
	 * The widgets that are constructed by a GtkUIManager can be embedded in
	 * other parts of the constructed user interface with the help of the
	 * “constructor” attribute. See the example below.
	 * 
	 * ## An embedded GtkUIManager UI definition
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->

		 * signal to get primitive, but consistent drag-and-drop support.
		 * 
		 * Things become more complicated when you try to preview the dragged data,
		 * as described in the documentation for #GtkWidget::drag-motion. The default
		 * behaviors described by #flags make some assumptions, that can conflict
		 * with your own signal handlers. For instance #GTK_DEST_DEFAULT_DROP causes
		 * invokations of {@link Gdk.drag.status} in the context of #GtkWidget::drag-motion,
		 * and invokations of gtk_drag_finish() in #GtkWidget::drag-data-received.
		 * Especially the later is dramatic, when your own #GtkWidget::drag-motion
		 * handler calls gtk_drag_get_data() to inspect the dragged data.
		 * 
		 * There’s no way to set a default action here, you can use the
		 * #GtkWidget::drag-motion callback for that. Here’s an example which selects
		 * the action to use depending on whether the control key is pressed or not:
		 * |[<!-- language="C" -->

	/**
	 * GtkWidget is the base class all widgets in GTK+ derive from. It manages the
	 * widget lifecycle, states and style.
	 * 
	 * # Height-for-width Geometry Management # {#geometry-management}
	 * 
	 * GTK+ uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
	 * system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
	 * vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
	 * that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
	 * example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
	 * to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
	 * 
	 * Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK+ by way
	 * of five virtual methods:
	 * 
	 * - {@link {@link WidgetClass}.get.request_mode}
	 * - #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width()
	 * - #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height()
	 * - #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width()
	 * - #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height()
	 * - #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width()
	 * 
	 * There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
	 * height-for-width and when using it in container implementations.
	 * 
	 * The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
	 * only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
	 * for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
	 * in the #GtkSizeRequestMode chosen by the toplevel.
	 * 
	 * For example, when queried in the normal
	 * %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH mode:
	 * First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
	 * in the interface will be computed using gtk_widget_get_preferred_width().
	 * Because the preferred widths for each container depend on the preferred
	 * widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
	 * and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
	 * toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
	 * minimum height contextual to that width using
	 * gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width(), which will also be a highly
	 * recursive operation. The minimum height for the minimum width is normally
	 * used to set the minimum size constraint on the toplevel
	 * (unless gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is explicitly used instead).
	 * 
	 * After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
	 * dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
	 * previously specified with gtk_window_set_default_size()). During the
	 * recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
	 * will be recursively executed while container widgets allocate their children.
	 * Each container widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
	 * space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
	 * height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
	 * depending. In this way a #GtkWidget will typically be requested its size
	 * a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
	 * widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
	 * requested. For this reason, #GtkWidget caches a  small number of results
	 * to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
	 * 
	 * See
	 * [GtkContainer’s geometry management section][container-geometry-management]
	 * to learn more about how height-for-width allocations are performed
	 * by container widgets.
	 * 
	 * If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
	 * allocated size then it must support the request in both
	 * #GtkSizeRequestModes even if the widget in question only
	 * trades sizes in a single orientation.
	 * 
	 * For instance, a #GtkLabel that does height-for-width word wrapping
	 * will not expect to have #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height() called
	 * because that call is specific to a width-for-height request. In this
	 * case the label must return the height required for its own minimum
	 * possible width. By following this rule any widget that handles
	 * height-for-width or width-for-height requests will always be allocated
	 * at least enough space to fit its own content.
	 * 
	 * Here are some examples of how a %GTK_SIZE_REQUEST_HEIGHT_FOR_WIDTH widget
	 * generally deals with width-for-height requests, for #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height()
	 * it will do:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_get_preferred_height (GtkWidget *widget,
	 *                                  gint *min_height,
	 *                                  gint *nat_height)
	 * {
	 *    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
	 *      {
	 *        gint min_width, nat_width;
	 * 
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
	 *                                                            &min_width,
	 *                                                            &nat_width);
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_height_for_width
	 *                                                           (widget,
	 *                                                            min_width,
	 *                                                            min_height,
	 *                                                            nat_height);
	 *      }
	 *    else
	 *      {
	 *         ... some widgets do both. For instance, if a GtkLabel is
	 *         rotated to 90 degrees it will return the minimum and
	 *         natural height for the rotated label here.
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * And in #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_width_for_height() it will simply return
	 * the minimum and natural width:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height (GtkWidget *widget,
	 *                                            gint for_height,
	 *                                            gint *min_width,
	 *                                            gint *nat_width)
	 * {
	 *    if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
	 *      {
	 *        GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
	 *                                                            min_width,
	 *                                                            nat_width);
	 *      }
	 *    else
	 *      {
	 *         ... again if a widget is sometimes operating in
	 *         width-for-height mode (like a rotated GtkLabel) it can go
	 *         ahead and do its real width for height calculation here.
	 *      }
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
	 * allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
	 * compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
	 * may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
	 * be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like this:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(widget)->get_preferred_width (widget,
	 *                                                    &min,
	 *                                                    &natural);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * It will not work to use the wrapper functions, such as
	 * gtk_widget_get_preferred_width() inside your own size request
	 * implementation. These return a request adjusted by #GtkSizeGroup
	 * and by the #GtkWidgetClass.adjust_size_request() virtual method. If a
	 * widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
	 * then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
	 * twice. GTK+ therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
	 * to do it.
	 * 
	 * Of course if you are getting the size request for
	 * another widget, such as a child of a
	 * container, you must use the wrapper APIs.
	 * Otherwise, you would not properly consider widget margins,
	 * #GtkSizeGroup, and so forth.
	 * 
	 * Since 3.10 GTK+ also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
	 * means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
	 * widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports baselines,
	 * has a vertical alignment of %GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE, and is inside a container
	 * that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to the baseline,
	 * or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
	 * 
	 * Baseline alignment support for a widget is done by the #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_and_baseline_for_width()
	 * virtual function. It allows you to report a baseline in combination with the
	 * minimum and natural height. If there is no baseline you can return -1 to indicate
	 * this. The default implementation of this virtual function calls into the
	 * #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height() and #GtkWidgetClass.get_preferred_height_for_width(),
	 * so if baselines are not supported it doesn’t need to be implemented.
	 * 
	 * If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in the parent
	 * as if it was %GTK_ALIGN_FILL, but the selected baseline can be found via gtk_widget_get_allocated_baseline().
	 * If this has a value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
	 * appears at the position.
	 * 
	 * # Style Properties
	 * 
	 * #GtkWidget introduces “style
	 * properties” - these are basically object properties that are stored
	 * not on the object, but in the style object associated to the widget. Style
	 * properties are set in [resource files][gtk3-Resource-Files].
	 * This mechanism is used for configuring such things as the location of the
	 * scrollbar arrows through the theme, giving theme authors more control over the
	 * look of applications without the need to write a theme engine in C.
	 * 
	 * Use gtk_widget_class_install_style_property() to install style properties for
	 * a widget class, gtk_widget_class_find_style_property() or
	 * gtk_widget_class_list_style_properties() to get information about existing
	 * style properties and gtk_widget_style_get_property(), gtk_widget_style_get() or
	 * gtk_widget_style_get_valist() to obtain the value of a style property.
	 * 
	 * # GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkWidget implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
	 * custom `<accelerator>` element, which has attributes named ”key”, ”modifiers”
	 * and ”signal” and allows to specify accelerators.
	 * 
	 * An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accelerator:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkButton">
	 *   <accelerator key="q" modifiers="GDK_CONTROL_MASK" signal="clicked"/>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * In addition to accelerators, GtkWidget also support a custom `<accessible>`
	 * element, which supports actions and relations. Properties on the accessible
	 * implementation of an object can be set by accessing the internal child
	 * “accessible” of a #GtkWidget.
	 * 
	 * An example of a UI definition fragment specifying an accessible:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1"/>
	 *   <property name="label">I am a Label for a Button</property>
	 * </object>
	 * <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
	 *   <accessibility>
	 *     <action action_name="click" translatable="yes">Click the button.</action>
	 *     <relation target="label1" type="labelled-by"/>
	 *   </accessibility>
	 *   <child internal-child="accessible">
	 *     <object class="AtkObject" id="a11y-button1">
	 *       <property name="accessible-name">Clickable Button</property>
	 *     </object>
	 *   </child>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Finally, GtkWidget allows style information such as style classes to
	 * be associated with widgets, using the custom `<style>` element:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
	 *   <style>
	 *     <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
	 *     <class name="dark-button"/>
	 *   </style>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # Building composite widgets from template XML ## {#composite-templates}
	 * 
	 * GtkWidget exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
	 * of creating composite widgets using #GtkBuilder interface description
	 * language.
	 * 
	 * To create composite widgets with #GtkBuilder XML, one must associate
	 * the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
	 * time using gtk_widget_class_set_template().
	 * 
	 * The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
	 * is slightly different from regular #GtkBuilder XML.
	 * 
	 * Unlike regular interface descriptions, gtk_widget_class_set_template() will
	 * expect a `<template>` tag as a direct child of the toplevel `<interface>`
	 * tag. The `<template>` tag must specify the “class” attribute which must be
	 * the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent” attribute may be
	 * specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget type, this is
	 * ignored by the GtkBuilder but required for Glade to introspect what kind
	 * of properties and internal children exist for a given type when the actual
	 * type does not exist.
	 * 
	 * The XML which is contained inside the `<template>` tag behaves as if it were
	 * added to the `<object>` tag defining "widget" itself. You may set properties
	 * on #widget by inserting `<property>` tags into the `<template>` tag, and also
	 * add `<child>` tags to add children and extend "widget" in the normal way you
	 * would with `<object>` tags.
	 * 
	 * Additionally, `<object>` tags can also be added before and after the initial
	 * `<template>` tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
	 * which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
	 * `<template>` tag.
	 * 
	 * An example of a GtkBuilder Template Definition:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <interface>
	 *   <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
	 *     <property name="orientation">GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL</property>
	 *     <property name="spacing">4</property>
	 *     <child>
	 *       <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
	 *         <property name="label">Hello World</property>
	 *         <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
	 *       </object>
	 *     </child>
	 *     <child>
	 *       <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
	 *         <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
	 *       </object>
	 *     </child>
	 *   </template>
	 * </interface>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
	 * bundled with your project, using #GResource. In order to load the
	 * template, you need to call gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource()
	 * from the class initialization of your #GtkWidget type:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
	 * {
	 *   // ...
	 * 
	 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
	 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * You will also need to call gtk_widget_init_template() from the instance
	 * initialization function:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
	 * {
	 *   // ...
	 *   gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * You can access widgets defined in the template using the
	 * gtk_widget_get_template_child() function, but you will typically declare
	 * a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
	 * name as the widget in the template definition, and call
	 * gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private() with that name, e.g.
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * typedef struct {
	 *   GtkWidget *hello_button;
	 *   GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
	 * } FooWidgetPrivate;
	 * 
	 * G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)
	 * 
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
	 * {
	 *   // ...
	 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
	 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
	 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
	 *                                                 FooWidget, hello_button);
	 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
	 *                                                 FooWidget, goodbye_button);
	 * }
	 * 
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
	 * {
	 * 
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * You can also use gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback() to connect a signal
	 * callback defined in the template with a function visible in the scope of the
	 * class, e.g.
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * // the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
	 * // because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
	 * static void
	 * hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
	 *                       GtkButton *button)
	 * {
	 *   g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
	 * }
	 * 
	 * static void
	 * foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
	 * {
	 *   // ...
	 *   gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
	 *                                                "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
	 *   gtk_widget_class_bind_template_callback (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass), hello_button_clicked);

	 * A GtkWindow is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
	 * Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
	 * of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
	 * (resize it, move it, close it,...).
	 * 
	 * # GtkWindow as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * The GtkWindow implementation of the {@link Buildable} interface supports a
	 * custom `<accel-groups>` element, which supports any number of `<group>`
	 * elements representing the #GtkAccelGroup objects you want to add to
	 * your window (synonymous with {@link Gtk.Window.add_accel_group}.
	 * 
	 * It also supports the `<initial-focus>` element, whose name property names
	 * the widget to receive the focus when the window is mapped.
	 * 
	 * An example of a UI definition fragment with accel groups:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkWindow">
	 *   <accel-groups>
	 *     <group name="accelgroup1"/>
	 *   </accel-groups>
	 *   <initial-focus name="thunderclap"/>
	 * </object>
	 * 
	 * ...
	 * 
	 * <object class="GtkAccelGroup" id="accelgroup1"/>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * The GtkWindow implementation of the #GtkBuildable interface supports
	 * setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
	 * attribute of a `<child>` element.
	 * 
	 * # CSS nodes
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
	 * window.background
	 * ├── decoration
	 * ├── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
	 * ╰── <child>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * GtkWindow has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background,
	 * and a subnode with name decoration.
	 * 
	 * Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
	 * client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
	 * without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
	 * decorations). GtkWindow also represents window states with the following
	 * style classes on the main node: .tiled, .maximized, .fullscreen. Specialized
	 * types of window often add their own discriminating style classes, such as
	 * .popup or .tooltip.
	 * 
	 * GtkWindow adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
	 * widget that is added as a titlebar child.

	/**
	 * {@link CellLayout} is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
	 * want to provide a #GtkTreeViewColumn like API for packing cells,
	 * setting attributes and data funcs.
	 * 
	 * One of the notable features provided by implementations of
	 * GtkCellLayout are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
	 * in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
	 * properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
	 * tree model with {@link Gtk.CellLayout.set_attributes}, which means that the value
	 * of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
	 * the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
	 * gtk_cell_layout_set_cell_data_func() that is called to determine the
	 * value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.
	 * 
	 * # GtkCellLayouts as GtkBuildable
	 * 
	 * Implementations of GtkCellLayout which also implement the GtkBuildable
	 * interface (#GtkCellView, #GtkIconView, #GtkComboBox,
	 * #GtkEntryCompletion, #GtkTreeViewColumn) accept GtkCellRenderer objects
	 * as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
	 * element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
	 * elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
	 * a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
	 * attribute value.
	 * 
	 * This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkCellView">
	 *   <child>
	 *     <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
	 *     <attributes>
	 *       <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
	 *     </attributes>
	 *   </child>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * Furthermore for implementations of GtkCellLayout that use a #GtkCellArea
	 * to lay out cells (all GtkCellLayouts in GTK+ use a GtkCellArea)
	 * [cell properties][cell-properties] can also be defined in the format by
	 * specifying the custom `<cell-packing>` attribute which can contain multiple
	 * `<property>` elements defined in the normal way.
	 * 
	 * Here is a UI definition fragment specifying cell properties:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="xml" -->
	 * <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn">
	 *   <child>
	 *     <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
	 *     <cell-packing>
	 *       <property name="align">True</property>
	 *       <property name="expand">False</property>
	 *     </cell-packing>
	 *   </child>
	 * </object>
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # Subclassing GtkCellLayout implementations
	 * 
	 * When subclassing a widget that implements #GtkCellLayout like
	 * #GtkIconView or #GtkComboBox, there are some considerations related
	 * to the fact that these widgets internally use a #GtkCellArea.
	 * The cell area is exposed as a construct-only property by these
	 * widgets. This means that it is possible to e.g. do
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * combo = g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
	 * are only initialized after instance init()
	 * functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
	 * the existence of the cell area in your subclass’ init() function will
	 * cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
	 * construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
	 * you to the problem).
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * static void
	 * my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
	 * {
	 *   GtkCellRenderer *cell;
	 * 
	 *   cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();
	 *   // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
	 *   // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
	 *   gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
	 *   ...
	 * }
	 * 
	 * GtkWidget *
	 * my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
	 * {
	 *   // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
	 *   return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
	 * not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
	 * to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
	 * problematic calls out of init() and into a constructor()
	 * for your class.

	type FileChooserMixin = IFileChooser;

	/**
	 * {@link FileChooser} is an interface that can be implemented by file
	 * selection widgets.  In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
	 * interface are #GtkFileChooserWidget, #GtkFileChooserDialog, and
	 * #GtkFileChooserButton.  You do not need to write an object that
	 * implements the #GtkFileChooser interface unless you are trying to
	 * adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
	 * interface.
	 * 
	 * #GtkFileChooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
	 * In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
	 * may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
	 * sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:
	 * 
	 * - Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
	 *   right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
	 *   can be renamed and deleted by the user.
	 * 
	 * - Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
	 *   program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
	 *   cannot be modified by the user.
	 * 
	 * - Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
	 *   the “roots” of the filesystem.
	 * 
	 * # File Names and Encodings
	 * 
	 * When the user is finished selecting files in a
	 * #GtkFileChooser, your program can get the selected names
	 * either as filenames or as URIs.  For URIs, the normal escaping
	 * rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
	 * However, filenames are always returned in
	 * the character set specified by the
	 * `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` environment variable.
	 * Please see the GLib documentation for more details about this
	 * variable.
	 * 
	 * This means that while you can pass the result of
	 * {@link Gtk.FileChooser.get_filename} to g_open() or g_fopen(),
	 * you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a
	 * #GtkLabel widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8,
	 * which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use g_filename_to_utf8()
	 * to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+
	 * widgets.
	 * 
	 * # Adding a Preview Widget
	 * 
	 * You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then
	 * get notification about when the preview needs to be updated.
	 * To install a preview widget, use
	 * gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget().  Then, connect to the
	 * #GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when
	 * you need to update the contents of the preview.
	 * 
	 * Your callback should use
	 * gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename() to see what needs
	 * previewing.  Once you have generated the preview for the
	 * corresponding file, you must call
	 * gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active() with a boolean
	 * flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully
	 * generate a preview.
	 * 
	 * ## Example: Using a Preview Widget ## {#gtkfilechooser-preview}
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * {
	 *   GtkImage *preview;
	 * 
	 *   ...
	 * 
	 *   preview = gtk_image_new ();
	 * 
	 *   gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
	 *   g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
	 * 		    G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
	 * }
	 * 
	 * static void
	 * update_preview_cb (GtkFileChooser *file_chooser, gpointer data)
	 * {
	 *   GtkWidget *preview;
	 *   char *filename;
	 *   GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
	 *   gboolean have_preview;
	 * 
	 *   preview = GTK_WIDGET (data);
	 *   filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename (file_chooser);
	 * 
	 *   pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size (filename, 128, 128, NULL);
	 *   have_preview = (pixbuf != NULL);
	 *   g_free (filename);
	 * 
	 *   gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE (preview), pixbuf);
	 *   if (pixbuf)
	 *     g_object_unref (pixbuf);
	 * 
	 *   gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active (file_chooser, have_preview);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * # Adding Extra Widgets
	 * 
	 * You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
	 * that are not present in the default design.  For example, you
	 * can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a
	 * file in read-only mode.  You can use
	 * gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget() to insert additional
	 * widgets in a file chooser.
	 * 
	 * An example for adding extra widgets:
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * 
	 *   GtkWidget *toggle;
	 * 
	 *   ...
	 * 
	 *   toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
	 *   gtk_widget_show (toggle);
	 *   gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
	 * }
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file
	 * chooser, you can a container such as a #GtkBox or a #GtkGrid
	 * and include your widgets in it.  Then, set the container as
	 * the whole extra widget.

	/**
	 * The {@link TreeModel} interface defines a generic tree interface for
	 * use by the #GtkTreeView widget. It is an abstract interface, and
	 * is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
	 * programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
	 * type for it to be viewable by a #GtkTreeView widget.
	 * 
	 * The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
	 * columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
	 * every node has different values depending on which column is being
	 * queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
	 * the GType system (ie. #G_TYPE_INT, #GTK_TYPE_BUTTON, #G_TYPE_POINTER,
	 * etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
	 * important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
	 * a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
	 * model decides how and if changes are made.
	 * 
	 * In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
	 * write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
	 * — the #GtkTreeStore and the #GtkListStore. To use these, the
	 * developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
	 * models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
	 * interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
	 * storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
	 * these two models are sufficient.
	 * 
	 * Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
	 * query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
	 * column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
	 * particular node in a model. They are the #GtkTreePath-struct and
	 * the #GtkTreeIter-struct (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
	 * interface consists of operations on a #GtkTreeIter-struct.
	 * 
	 * A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
	 * that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
	 * model. The #GtkTreePath-struct can be converted into either an
	 * array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
	 * of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
	 * at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
	 * node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
	 * the third node.
	 * 
	 * By contrast, a #GtkTreeIter-struct is a reference to a specific node on
	 * a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
	 * generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
	 * way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
	 * {@link Gtk.TreeModel.get_iter}. These iterators are the primary way
	 * of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
	 * #GtkTextBuffer. They are generally statically allocated on the
	 * stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
	 * a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
	 * 
	 * It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
	 * For example, the #GtkListStore model, which is internally a simple
	 * linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
	 * #GtkTreeModelSort stores an array and an offset in two of the
	 * pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
	 * generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
	 * catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
	 * 
	 * The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
	 * Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
	 * is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
	 * to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
	 * free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
	 * guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
	 * to is valid (most notably the #GtkTreeStore and #GtkListStore).
	 * Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
	 * the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
	 * important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
	 * As a result, the #GTK_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to
	 * indicate this behavior.
	 * 
	 * To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
	 * provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
	 * the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
	 * easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
	 * callbacks.

	 * 
	 * The #GtkTreeModel interface contains two methods for reference
	 * counting: gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node().
	 * These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
	 * is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
	 * displayed. #GtkTreeView will take a reference on a node when it is
	 * visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
	 * Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
	 * visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
	 * scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
	 * a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
	 * not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
	 * folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
	 * 
	 * When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
	 * into account:
	 * 
	 * - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
	 *   This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
	 *   as well.
	 * 
	 * - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
	 *   possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
	 *   row-deleted signal is received.
	 * 
	 * - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
	 *   siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
	 *   required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
	 *   however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
	 *   is always referenced when any view is attached).

	 * While you should not call this function directly, you might want to
	 * know how exactly events are handled. So here is what this function
	 * does with the event:
	 * 
	 * 1. Compress enter/leave notify events. If the event passed build an
	 *    enter/leave pair together with the next event (peeked from GDK), both
	 *    events are thrown away. This is to avoid a backlog of (de-)highlighting
	 *    widgets crossed by the pointer.
	 * 
	 * 2. Find the widget which got the event. If the widget can’t be determined
	 *    the event is thrown away unless it belongs to a INCR transaction.
	 * 
	 * 3. Then the event is pushed onto a stack so you can query the currently
	 *    handled event with {@link Gtk.get.current_event}.
	 * 
	 * 4. The event is sent to a widget. If a grab is active all events for widgets
	 *    that are not in the contained in the grab widget are sent to the latter
	 *    with a few exceptions:
	 *    - Deletion and destruction events are still sent to the event widget for
	 *      obvious reasons.
	 *    - Events which directly relate to the visual representation of the event
	 *      widget.
	 *    - Leave events are delivered to the event widget if there was an enter
	 *      event delivered to it before without the paired leave event.
	 *    - Drag events are not redirected because it is unclear what the semantics
	 *      of that would be.
	 *    Another point of interest might be that all key events are first passed
	 *    through the key snooper functions if there are any. Read the description
	 *    of gtk_key_snooper_install() if you need this feature.
	 *
