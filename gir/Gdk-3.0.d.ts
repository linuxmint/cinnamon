	/**
	 * In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input,
	 * GDK contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics
	 * tablets, touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting
	 * simultaneously with the user interface. Such input devices often have
	 * additional features, such as sub-pixel positioning information and
	 * additional device-dependent information.
	 * 
	 * In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the
	 * device hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or
	 * physical devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides
	 * {@link DeviceManager}.
	 * 
	 * By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
	 * keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be
	 * changed by calling {@link Gdk.disable.multidevice} before gdk_display_open().
	 * There should rarely be a need to do that though, since GDK defaults
	 * to a compatibility mode in which it will emit just one enter/leave
	 * event pair for all devices on a window. To enable per-device
	 * enter/leave events and other multi-pointer interaction features,
	 * gdk_window_set_support_multidevice() must be called on
	 * #GdkWindows (or gtk_widget_set_support_multidevice() on widgets).
	 * window. See the gdk_window_set_support_multidevice() documentation
	 * for more information.
	 * 
	 * On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2.
	 * Unless gdk_disable_multidevice() is called, the XInput 2
	 * #GdkDeviceManager implementation will be used as the input source.
	 * Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be used.
	 * 
	 * For simple applications that don’t have any special interest in
	 * input devices, the so-called “client pointer”
	 * provides a reasonable approximation to a simple setup with a single
	 * pointer and keyboard. The device that has been set as the client
	 * pointer can be accessed via gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer().
	 * 
	 * Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual
	 * devices (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors
	 * and keyboard foci that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or
	 * slave devices) represent the hardware that is controlling the virtual
	 * devices, and thus have no visible cursor on the screen.
	 * 
	 * Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
	 * pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through
	 * gdk_device_get_associated_device().
	 * 
	 * There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could
	 * be controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also
	 * be “floating”, which means they are not attached to any virtual device.

	 * 
	 * By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all
	 * master devices, setting the #GdkDevice for all events coming from input
	 * devices. Events containing device information are #GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY,
	 * #GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS,
	 * #GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, #GDK_SCROLL, #GDK_KEY_PRESS, #GDK_KEY_RELEASE,

	 * #GDK_PROXIMITY_IN, #GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT, #GDK_DRAG_ENTER, #GDK_DRAG_LEAVE,
	 * #GDK_DRAG_MOTION, #GDK_DRAG_STATUS, #GDK_DROP_START, #GDK_DROP_FINISHED
	 * and #GDK_GRAB_BROKEN. When dealing with an event on a master device,
	 * it is possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated
	 * from via gdk_event_get_source_device().
	 * 
	 * On a standard session, all physical devices are connected by default to
	 * the "Virtual Core Pointer/Keyboard" master devices, hence routing all events
	 * through these. This behavior is only modified by device grabs, where the
	 * slave device is temporarily detached for as long as the grab is held, and
	 * more permanently by user modifications to the device hierarchy.
	 * 
	 * On certain application specific setups, it may make sense
	 * to detach a physical device from its master pointer, and mapping it to
	 * an specific window. This can be achieved by the combination of
	 * gdk_device_grab() and gdk_device_set_mode().
	 * 
	 * In order to listen for events coming from devices
	 * other than a virtual device, gdk_window_set_device_events() must be
	 * called. Generally, this function can be used to modify the event mask
	 * for any given device.
	 * 
	 * Input devices may also provide additional information besides X/Y.
	 * For example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and X/Y tilt
	 * information. This information is device-dependent, and may be
	 * queried through gdk_device_get_axis(). In multidevice mode, virtual
	 * devices will change axes in order to always represent the physical
	 * device that is routing events through it. Whenever the physical device
	 * changes, the #GdkDevice:n-axes property will be notified, and
	 * gdk_device_list_axes() will return the new device axes.
	 * 
	 * Devices may also have associated “keys” or
	 * macro buttons. Such keys can be globally set to map into normal X
	 * keyboard events. The mapping is set using gdk_device_set_key().
	 * 
	 * In GTK+ 3.20, a new #GdkSeat object has been introduced that
	 * supersedes #GdkDeviceManager and should be preferred in newly
	 * written code.

		 * when comparing this key press to a hot key. For instance, on a US keyboard,
		 * the `plus` symbol is shifted, so when comparing a key press to a
		 * `<Control>plus` accelerator `<Shift>` should be masked out.
		 * 
		 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
		 * // We want to ignore irrelevant modifiers like ScrollLock
		 * #define ALL_ACCELS_MASK (GDK_CONTROL_MASK | GDK_SHIFT_MASK | GDK_MOD1_MASK)

		 *   // Control was pressed

		 * 
		 * An older interpretation #consumed_modifiers was that it contained
		 * all modifiers that might affect the translation of the key;
		 * this allowed accelerators to be stored with irrelevant consumed
		 * modifiers, by doing:
		 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
		 * // XXX Don’t do this XXX
		 * if (keyval == accel_keyval &&
		 *     (event->state & ~consumed & ALL_ACCELS_MASK) == (accel_mods & ~consumed))
		 *   // Accelerator was pressed
		 * ]|

		 * However, this did not work if multi-modifier combinations were
		 * used in the keymap, since, for instance, `<Control>` would be
		 * masked out even if only `<Control><Alt>` was used in the keymap.
		 * To support this usage as well as well as possible, all single
		 * modifier combinations that could affect the key for any combination
		 * of modifiers will be returned in #consumed_modifiers; multi-modifier
		 * combinations are returned only when actually found in #state. When
		 * you store accelerators, you should always store them with consumed
		 * modifiers removed. Store `<Control>plus`, not `<Control><Shift>plus`,

	export interface GeometryInitOptions {}
	/**
	 * The {@link Geometry} struct gives the window manager information about

	 * the GTK+ level using {@link Gtk.Window.set_geometry_hints}. #GtkWindow
	 * then sets the hints on the #GdkWindow it creates.
	 * 
	 * gdk_window_set_geometry_hints() expects the hints to be fully valid already
	 * and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
	 * gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() performs some interpretation. For example,
	 * #GtkWindow will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the
	 * toplevel window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
	 * #min_width/#min_height/#max_width/#max_height fields may be set to -1, and
	 * #GtkWindow will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget.
	 * If the minimum size hint is not provided, #GtkWindow will use its requisition
	 * as the minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is
	 * set, #GtkWindow will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the
	 * geometry widget rather than the entire window. The base size is treated
	 * similarly.
	 * 
	 * The canonical use-case for gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is to get a
	 * terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be
	 * the geometry widget; #GtkWindow will then automatically set the base size to
	 * the size of other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and
	 * scrollbar. Then, the #width_inc and #height_inc fields should be set to the
	 * size of one character in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set
	 * to the size of one character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the
	 * terminal will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on
	 * the “character grid” will be allowed.
	 * 
	 * Here’s an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming
	 * a terminal area widget called “terminal” and a toplevel window “toplevel”:
	 * 
	 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
	 * 	GdkGeometry hints;
	 * 
	 * 	hints.base_width = terminal->char_width;

	 *         hints.min_width = terminal->char_width;
	 *         hints.min_height = terminal->char_height;
	 *         hints.width_inc = terminal->char_width;
	 *         hints.height_inc = terminal->char_height;
	 * 
	 *  gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (toplevel),
	 *                                 GTK_WIDGET (terminal),
	 *                                 &hints,
	 *                                 GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC |
	 *                                 GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |
	 *                                 GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE);
	 * ]|
	 * 
	 * The other useful fields are the #min_aspect and #max_aspect fields; these
	 * contain a width/height ratio as a floating point number. If a geometry widget
	 * is set, the aspect applies to the geometry widget rather than the entire
	 * window. The most common use of these hints is probably to set #min_aspect and
	 * #max_aspect to the same value, thus forcing the window to keep a constant
