/**
 * SECTION:st-scrollable
 * @short_description: A #ClutterActor that can be scrolled
 *
 * The #StScrollable interface is exposed by actors that support scrolling.
 *
 * The interface contains methods for getting and setting the adjustments
 * for scrolling; these adjustments will be used to hook the scrolled
 * position up to scrollbars or other external controls. When a #StScrollable
 * is added to a parent container, the parent container is responsible
 * for setting the adjustments. The parent container then sets the adjustments
 * back to %NULL when the scrollable is removed.
 *
 * For #StScrollable supporting height-for-width size negotiation, size
 * negotiation works as follows:
 *
 * In response to get_preferred_width(), the scrollable should report
 * the minimum width at which horizontal scrolling is needed for the
 * preferred width, and natural width of the actor when not
 * horizontally scrolled as the natural width.
 *
 * The for_width passed into get_preferred_height() is the width at which
 * the scrollable will be allocated; this will be smaller than the minimum
 * width when scrolling horizontally, so the scrollable may want to adjust
 * it up to the minimum width before computing a preferred height. (Other
 * scrollables may want to fit as much content into the allocated area
 * as possible and only scroll what absolutely needs to scroll - consider,
 * for example, the line-wrapping behavior of a text editor where there
 * is a long line without any spaces.) As for width, get_preferred_height()
 * should return the minimum size at which no scrolling is needed for the
 * minimum height, and the natural size of the actor when not vertically scrolled
 * as the natural height.
 *
 * In allocate() the allocation box passed in will be actual allocated
 * size of the actor so will be smaller than the reported minimum
 * width and/or height when scrolling is present. Any scrollable actor
 * must support being allocated at any size down to 0x0 without
 * crashing, however if the actor has content around the scrolled area
 * and has an absolute minimum size that's bigger than 0x0 its
 * acceptable for it to misdraw between 0x0 and the absolute minimum
 * size. It's up to the application author to avoid letting the user
 * resize the scroll view small enough so that the scrolled area
 * vanishes.
 *
 * In response to allocate, in addition to normal handling, the
 * scrollable should also set the limits of the the horizontal and
 * vertical adjustments that were set on it earlier. The standard
 * settings are:
 *
 *  lower: 0
 *  page_size: allocated size (width or height)
 *  upper: MAX (total size of the scrolled area,allocated_size)
 *  step_increment: natural row/column height or a fixed fraction of the page size
 *  page_increment: page_size - step_increment
