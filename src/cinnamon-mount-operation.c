/* This is a dummy class; we would like to be able to subclass the
 * object from JS but we can't yet; the default GMountOperation impl
 * automatically calls g_mount_operation_reply(UNHANDLED) after an idle,
 * in interactive methods. We want to handle the reply outselves
 * instead, so we just override the default methods with empty ones,
 * except for ask-password, as we don't want to handle that.
 *
 * Also, we need to workaround the fact that gjs doesn't support type
 * annotations for signals yet (so we can't effectively forward e.g. 
 * the GPid array to JS).
 * See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=645978
