gnome-shell (3.2.1-0ubuntu1) oneiric-proposed; urgency=low

  [ Jeremy Bicha ]
  * New upstream release (LP: #878672).
    - Restore the IM state on startup - if you were available in when you
      logged out, then you'll be set available again when you log in.
    - Improve searching for contacts in the overview: search more fields,
      show a more meaningful name, require that all search terms match.
    - Improve search for applications in the overview: take frequency into
      account and tweak match algorithm
    - Remove the "Show Password" switch from network password prompts, and
      move the functionality to a right-click menu
    - Add context menus with Cut/Paste options to most entries
    - Display a caps-lock warning in password entries
    - Show the state of installed extensions in Looking Glass

      application with certain applications such as Emacs.
    - Fix confusion between different users avatar images
    - Remove behavior where you could switch workspaces by bumping
      a dragged window in the overview against a screen edge; it was
      leftover and just confusing.
    - Fix long-standing bug where the Dash in the overview could end up
      mis-sized and run off the screen
    - Fix automatic launching of applications when media is inserted
    - Fix handling of vertically stacked monitors with NVIDIA drivers

      + Fix problem with keyboard hiding when selected accented characters

  * debian/control.in:
    - Bump minimum mutter to 3.2.1
    - Drop dependency against libdconf0 and let dh_installgsettings set

  * 01_favorite_apps.patch: dropped, replaced by override file.

    under Unity, as we show/use system-config-printer there, but in the GNOME

    workaround for oneiric to avoid adding cups-pk-helper to main and the
    default install after FF. (LP: #844864)
