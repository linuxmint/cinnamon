  * dnd: call handleDragOut on a drop tartget (if available) when leaving the area, and use this function to remove the drag placeholder when dragging an applet. This fixes an issue where the drag placeholder would get stuck after a dnd, leaving an empty space with no applets
  * Simplify how applet positions are saved after a dnd operation and allow extra properties to be added to a definition in the enabled-applets key

With this change, the user is now prompted with the following options: 1. Leave the applet on the panel anyway (some applets are still suitable for vertical panels under certain circumstances - even if they aren't marked as such). In this case an override is added to the applet definition to avoid the user being prompted in the future. 2. Remove the applet. 3. Try to move the applet to a different panel. If a suitable panel cannot be found, the applet is removed instead.
  * Don't let hidden panels offset the menu position. It can lead to awkward placement in situations such as when there are mixed panels and auto-hide is involved

  * st-texture-cache.c: don't cache st_texture_cache_load_from_raw - its only user is the notificationDaemon.  These are transient images that were being stored in the cache that would never be evicted during theme changes (this does not just mean times when the user changed the icon them.)

  * notificationDaemon.js: Silence an occasional warning.

  [ BinHong Lee ]
  * Progress bar text initializes and resets

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings-users: Restrict the size of user images, as they are displayed in the right view when a user is selected.  If the image at /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user> is set to a ridiculously-sized image, it won't break the ui.
  * cs_user: Don't let large images break the ui - make sure we scale the selected image to an appropriate size.  Also, don't crop user-selected images (but keep cropping webcam images) - it's strange to select an image file and have the ends of it cut off.
  * cinnamon-settings-users.py: Fix picture preview in file selector to maintain a reasonable size.
  * cs_user.py: Handle image previews better in the face chooser dialog.

  [ Jason Hicks ]
  * ChooserButtonWidgets.py: Fix Python 3 error

  [ brownsr ]
  * window-list: bring space around preview down and correct a calculation problem beta testing user asked for the space around the window preview to be brought in a bit that in turn highlighted a bug where the scaling was calculated without taking the icon+title into effect I've brought the spare space down a bit, but I can't bring it down further and have it look right in all themes without major surgery, which would be best done in a development cycle.  The space allowance for the icon is not fully adequate as the title font could be set large, and so take up more room than the icon. But I've tried with this height adjustment and this scaling across a wide selection of themes, and it appears to stand up.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings-users, cs-user, ChooserButtonWidgets: let GdkPixbuf do the work of restricting the size of images while maintaining aspect ratio.  Follow-up to last few commits.
  * StScrollView: queue redraws whenever the adjustments change, to prevent artifacts outside of the view itself.
  * StScrollView: More effective way of fixing the graphical artifacts generated during scrolling.  This also appears to fix some unrelated tearing issues I was seeing in the menu while testing.
  * main.c: Own onboard's dbus name to prevent it starting when gnome's a11y keyboard settings key is active (org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled.) Also own caribou's daemon.  Caribou's OSK won't interfere in a Cinnamon session, but its daemon will run needlessly in the background otherwise.

  * StScrollView: queue redraws whenever the adjustments change, to prevent artifacts outside of the view itself.
  * spacer applet: use a unique style class in the theme to prevent the applet from appearing active when hovered.
  * theme: add applet-spacer class for spacer applet.

  * menu applet (vector box): partially revert c0d37dd79d68c97 - there is flickering as events go from a button to the vector box and back.  Remove the idle callback, and directly react to the enter even once more.

cinnamon (3.2.8) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * menu applet: Only construct one context menu for recent files, and re-use it.
  * cs_screensaver.py: Re-use the Gtk.Socket always - it can hold both Gtk.Plugs and normal Gtk.Widgets, just treat it like a normal bin/container.  This seems to assist on ref-cleanup and child reaping when switching screensavers. (observed on Arch, reported on Arch and Fedora)
  * menu applet: Don't reconstruct recent files, just re-order, add, remove as required.
  * menu applet: Fix a couple of minor leaks (actors created but never added to a container - being GInitiallyUnowned, they never get their floating ref sunk, and so can't be unreffed.  Fix a prototype mis-match, and just rename GenericButton to NoRecentDocsButton, since that's the only user of it.
  * menu applet: Some fixes for previous commits, don't be so destructive when refreshing applications.
  * Revert "cs_screensaver.py: Re-use the Gtk.Socket always - it can hold both Gtk.Plugs"
  * Fix tuples for python 3.6
  * tooltips.js: add a hide timer to check if a tooltip should hide itself, but for various reasons never got to act on a leave-event (due to vagaries in event reporting).
  * recent applet: Rework to be non-destructive when updating the recent list (this brings a lot of the recent changes to the menu applet over to this one.)
  * recents, applets: Couple warning cleanups
  * network applet: Remove a useless log warning.  At some point more than a year ago we started getting these (possibly a change to network-manager), they have no value whatsoever, but fill up the log.

  * cs_screensaver.py: expose new cinnamon screensaver settings
  * cinnamon-settings.py: refactor maybe_resize slightly

  [ brownsr ]
  * ensure applets that override on_panel_height_changed  get to scale properly The logic in the common applet code has been changed so that the scaling is not overridden by the locally overridden function.  The local function thus becomes additional to the core function, rather than overriding it in its entirety. This also corrects errors associated with turning scale mode on and off. One more associated change to the window-list applet in a vertical panel will be needed but as there are changes queued up for that I think it's best done subsequently fixes #5700
  * Ensure that the edge of the screen reacts to mouse clicks Previously the outside couple of pixels were unreactive.  This was set so as to avoid recursion errors but these seem no longer to be there, so this resets to the desired behaviour

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Add a generic "bluetooth" icon

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * power applet: Don't connect to any signals that call _devicesChanged until we have the power proxy (since the callbacks assume we do have it).
  * windowAttentionHandler.js: make the ignored app check case- insensitive.  While we're here make it a gsettings array for convenience.
  * org.cinnamon.gschema.in - add pidgin to ignored wm classes.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Touchpad settings: Invert motion-threshold setting widget

  [ Michael Webster ]

  * cinnamon-recorder: fix crash when starting recorder...
  * cinnamon-recorder.c: restore avoidance of the panel when drawing the recording indicators.  This was removed during some panel work a while back and never restored.  Always draw them on the primary monitor now (the only monitor with reliable, simple-to-get workarea information).

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Themes settings: Fixed loading icon themes when a theme isn't readable

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * popupMenu.js: use the signalManager.disconnect correctly - the source actor (the panel actor for the applet) has to be the second argument, the object to disconnect from.  Was causing flickering in the menu applet after repositioning it.

  * tray icons: Bump icon request to 24, then scale back to 20 in the applet.  This is needed due to changes to GtkIconSize values in Gtk3. GtkStatusIcon iterates thru the built-in icon sizes to pick an appropriate icon to use, and as of 3.18 there are no sizes between 16 and 24px.

  * ExtensionCore.py: scan_extension_thread - if the metadata.json file is not found, this must be a versioned xlet, check the parent folder for it instead.
  * cs_power.py: Expose setting to allow lid-closed action even when external monitors are attached.
  * messageTray.js: Don't let notifications with buttons fade on mouse-over.

  * cs_sound.py: Few fixes to the volume slider/mute button:

cinnamon (2.8.7) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_keyboard.py: Fix event handlers for teaching keybindings - the cursor-down and -up keys were being incorrectly used to navigate the tree view during teach mode, and it was breaking focus (and cancelling the teach.)
  * magnifier: limit max zoom to a reasonable value
  * menu applet: Fix vfade in the program list - it was only showing when desktop zoom was turned entirely off.  We've reworked zoom since then, so that the .applications key only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or not - actual zoom activation occurs only when the magnification factor becomes > 1.0.
  * screensaver: Fix proxy to listen to the correct service, fix layout changes when the screensaver starts/stops.

  * Alt-tab: Speed up preview backdrop animation a little more
  * Alt-tab: Classic switcher, don't animate thumbnail removal (it looks weird when switching to the next window..). Also, increase the delay to show thumbs to 300ms. Both 180ms and 300ms seem slow when trying to identify windows by their thumbs, but 180ms gets in the way and shows shadow-thumbs when pressing Alt at "normal" speed.

  * popupMenu: Add back the expander arrow on PopupSubMenuMenuItem but with a different layout. Also tweak the layout of a couple of our applet menus to look nicer with this change. The addition of the icons to Cinnamon itself is a workaround for Mint. Newer versions of the gnome icon theme have these as built in icons but not in the version supplied with Mint 17. They can be removed in the future.
  * bg: add "spanned" to the list of bg types that need to show the background color options
  * popupMenu: add back a couple checks for the existence of submenu expander arrow to prevent breaking the right click context menus in the menu applet
  * use the new meta_screen_get_current_monitor() to place appswitchers and modal dialogs on the proper monitor in multiple monitor setups
  * workspace-applet: properly dispose a cairo context
  * cs_windows: Reword a setting to match https://github.com/linuxmint/muffin/pull/204
  * windowManager: Make the window dimming effect with attached dialogs a bit stronger and more obvious
  * windowManager: Properly declare a variable
  * add new slider and separator objects
  * workspace-switcher: Rework the visual style workspace switcher so it can be themed. Also fix some st_theme_node warnings and stop windows from being able to be drawn outside the workspace background
  * cs_startup: set modal to true for both the "Choose application" and "Add custom command" dialogs so the behavior is the same for both when using attached dialogs
  * rework the window list and effects so minimize effects work properly with multiple window lists on multiple monitors
  * sound-applet: make the volume slider for individual applications fully expand

  * capi.py:  Move with rest of cinnamon-settings files to their new location, remove debian sed rule for multiarch fix, instead figure out the right location in the capi code.  Cinnamon-bluetooth is not MultiarchSpec compliant, so we still need to *also* load from /usr/lib/*.
  * st-widget.c: Fix typo in st_widget_recompute_style

  * Automatically reload xlets when updating them instead of showing an info dialog
  * extension.js: Enable imports in a xlet via import.xlet (where xlet is the type of xlet; applet, desklet, extension or search_provider) cinnamon-js.cpp: Removed cinnamon_js_add_extension_importer

  * desklets: Make sure a new desklet is placed in a visible portion of the primary monitor.
  * photo desklet: Fix a warning, clock desklet: move some String class overrides to js/ui/overrides.js so they can be used in the desklet as well as the calendar applet.
  * panel applet: always remove the drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * menu applet: always remove a favorites drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * Added missing dependency on gir1.2-notify-0.7
  * Cinnamon Settings: Properly handle themes which thumbnail isn't readable

  * sound applet: fixed #3735 - mute on middle click
  * windowManager.js: Fix opacity issues when using fade mapping, and other effects involving opacity changes.
  * cinnamon-settings keyboard: fix Escape key handling to cancel keybinding teach mode (when numlock is on), and allow backspace to be used as a hotkey when modified.
  * keybindings: Ignore capslock for teach mode
  * keybindings: force lower case when comparing existing keybindings for collisions.
  * Fixed scroll direction in window list applet
  * layout.js: don't hide/show the panels during the startup animation, make them temporarily transparent instead - this fixes an issue when panel auto-hide is active, the animation will complete, and you'll see a temporary blank area where the panel would be, as the chrome adjusts to the panel.
  * layout.js: Only alter panel behavior during animation when the panel auto-hide is actually active - it 'looks' better during startup for any non-auto-hidden panel.
  * appletManager.js: Don't dump orphaned applets into the remaining panel when changing layouts from double to single panel.  They are silently ignored. They will show as having an issue in applet settings (red dot) and a looking glass log note, describing how to fix, if desired.
  * keybindings: Filter out reserved GdkModifierTypes - they can interfere with keybindings on certain systems.
  * classicSwitcher.js: prevent warning from an errant source id.
  * app switcher:  Fix double-destroy when activating a minimized window. The app switchers listen for the 'map' signal from windows - a mapping signal triggers an _activateWindow, and we also get an activate from actually selecting the window in the first place.
  * st-im-text.c: Fix capslock in StEntry widgets.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Fix warning from invalid source id.
  * overrides.js: Add dump_stack when .disconnecting with an invalid ID.
  * classicSwitcher.js: Force a re-allocation of the alt-tab container when a thumbnail/preview is removed.
  * Fixed default avatar image path
  * menu applet: Don't reset the category when dragging an app.
  * st-texture-cache.c: Make sure the pixbuf requested ends up with the correct-sized texture (instead of the original texture size) - StIcon's update_shadow_material method was getting a bad size to generate the shadow/blur.
  * Rename the stock cinnamon menu applet icon so it gets rendered correctly as a symbolic icon.
  * applet.js: Make sure set_applet_icon_symbolic_name and _path use a good size when scale mode is off.  Also reduce the padding of the menu-symbolic.svg icon so its visible size is more in line with other symbolic icons.
  * menu applet: Fix logic surrounding the default icon.
