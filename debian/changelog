  * menu applet: recalculate applications list box height when the menu's allocation changes.

  [ Stephen Collins ]
  * Applets: when setting an icon, make sure it's actually an St.Icon. Some applets (such as the keyboard applet) set _applet_icon to something other than an St.Icon, so it causes an error when trying to set the icon using one of the api functions. This was causing the keyboard applet not to show in panel edit mode after a keyboard layout was added and removed. (#7008)

  * initialise applet position to avoid drag and drop errors in edit mode occasionally the null applet position was being carried through to the writing of the new applet causing apparent drop failures, and to the disappearance of the highlighted drop box.  Much visible weirdness with a very simple solution

  * workspace switcher: fix undeclared variable warning
  * applet settings: Improve the logic for highlighting the panel. The panel is now only highlighted when there is more than one panel, and it's better about selecting and highlighting the correct panel when one is added or removed

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * osdWindow.js: Always check the theme node on first showing - an actor's width isn't necessarily filled if it hasn't been explicitly set, causing the first few activations of the OSD to not show an accurate level bar.

  * systray: Improve icon scaling in hidpi They were coming up a bit small. Indicator icons were coming up double size. The default of 16px indicator icons in non-scaled panels was awfully blurry. Icon spacing appeared to be scaled up in hidpi for no good reason.

  * dnd: call handleDragOut on a drop tartget (if available) when leaving the area, and use this function to remove the drag placeholder when dragging an applet. This fixes an issue where the drag placeholder would get stuck after a dnd, leaving an empty space with no applets
  * Simplify how applet positions are saved after a dnd operation and allow extra properties to be added to a definition in the enabled-applets key
  * Improve the way cinnamon handles applets that are added to an unsupported panel. Previously, Cinnamon would send a message to cinnamon-settings saying there was an error. With this change, the user is now prompted with the following options: 1. Leave the applet on the panel anyway (some applets are still suitable for vertical panels under certain circumstances - even if they aren't marked as such). In this case an override is added to the applet definition to avoid the user being prompted in the future. 2. Remove the applet. 3. Try to move the applet to a different panel. If a suitable panel cannot be found, the applet is removed instead.
  * Don't let hidden panels offset the menu position. It can lead to awkward placement in situations such as when there are mixed panels and auto-hide is involved

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings-users: Restrict the size of user images, as they are displayed in the right view when a user is selected.  If the image at /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user> is set to a ridiculously-sized image, it won't break the ui.
  * cs_user: Don't let large images break the ui - make sure we scale the selected image to an appropriate size.  Also, don't crop user-selected images (but keep cropping webcam images) - it's strange to select an image file and have the ends of it cut off.

  * window-list: bring space around preview down and correct a calculation problem beta testing user asked for the space around the window preview to be brought in a bit that in turn highlighted a bug where the scaling was calculated without taking the icon+title into effect I've brought the spare space down a bit, but I can't bring it down further and have it look right in all themes without major surgery, which would be best done in a development cycle.  The space allowance for the icon is not fully adequate as the title font could be set large, and so take up more room than the icon. But I've tried with this height adjustment and this scaling across a wide selection of themes, and it appears to stand up.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings-users, cs-user, ChooserButtonWidgets: let GdkPixbuf do the work of restricting the size of images while maintaining aspect ratio.  Follow-up to last few commits.
  * StScrollView: queue redraws whenever the adjustments change, to prevent artifacts outside of the view itself.
  * StScrollView: More effective way of fixing the graphical artifacts generated during scrolling.  This also appears to fix some unrelated tearing issues I was seeing in the menu while testing.
  * main.c: Own onboard's dbus name to prevent it starting when gnome's a11y keyboard settings key is active (org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled.) Also own caribou's daemon.  Caribou's OSK won't interfere in a Cinnamon session, but its daemon will run needlessly in the background otherwise.

cinnamon (3.2.8) serena; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * menu applet: Only construct one context menu for recent files, and re-use it.
  * cs_screensaver.py: Re-use the Gtk.Socket always - it can hold both Gtk.Plugs and normal Gtk.Widgets, just treat it like a normal bin/container.  This seems to assist on ref-cleanup and child reaping when switching screensavers. (observed on Arch, reported on Arch and Fedora)
  * menu applet: Don't reconstruct recent files, just re-order, add, remove as required.
  * menu applet: Fix a couple of minor leaks (actors created but never added to a container - being GInitiallyUnowned, they never get their floating ref sunk, and so can't be unreffed.  Fix a prototype mis-match, and just rename GenericButton to NoRecentDocsButton, since that's the only user of it.
  * menu applet: Some fixes for previous commits, don't be so destructive when refreshing applications.
  * Revert "cs_screensaver.py: Re-use the Gtk.Socket always - it can hold both Gtk.Plugs"
  * Fix tuples for python 3.6
  * tooltips.js: add a hide timer to check if a tooltip should hide itself, but for various reasons never got to act on a leave-event (due to vagaries in event reporting).
  * recent applet: Rework to be non-destructive when updating the recent list (this brings a lot of the recent changes to the menu applet over to this one.)
  * recents, applets: Couple warning cleanups
  * network applet: Remove a useless log warning.  At some point more than a year ago we started getting these (possibly a change to network-manager), they have no value whatsoever, but fill up the log.

  * Correct drag and drop bugs in panel launcher 1) an issue that looks to have been there before the vertical panels change where    drag and drop within the panel launcher would drop icons in unscaled rather    than at the same scale as the other icons 2) a vertical panels issue where the drag and drop code was assuming horizontal orientation    and so was calculating both the position in the list of icons and the new position in the    actor incorrectly 3) took the opportunity to correct a number of minor indentation issues
  * correct window list internal drag and drop for vertical panels 1) The override on the allowable drag direction was not set to allow vertical dragging    also previous override needed clearing when orientation changed 2) Removed a few stray tabs etc. 3) Calculated the drop position correctly for vertical panels

  * workspace switcher - change whether graph is shown or not At the moment the graph is suppressed in vertical panels because a long wide workspace resulting from multiple monitors results in an unworkable graph when scaled to fit the panel width. Change this to test on the workspace size ratio, as this will permit single monitor setups to have the workspace graph
  * add vertical style class to workspace switcher No code is needed to remove it as buttons are rebuilt from scratch when panels are moved between orientations. Linked to a change to improve appearance of this applet in vertical panels in Mint-X themes

  * cs_screensaver.py: expose new cinnamon screensaver settings
  * cinnamon-settings.py: refactor maybe_resize slightly

  [ brownsr ]
  * ensure applets that override on_panel_height_changed  get to scale properly The logic in the common applet code has been changed so that the scaling is not overridden by the locally overridden function.  The local function thus becomes additional to the core function, rather than overriding it in its entirety. This also corrects errors associated with turning scale mode on and off. One more associated change to the window-list applet in a vertical panel will be needed but as there are changes queued up for that I think it's best done subsequently fixes #5700
  * Ensure that the edge of the screen reacts to mouse clicks Previously the outside couple of pixels were unreactive.  This was set so as to avoid recursion errors but these seem no longer to be there, so this resets to the desired behaviour

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Add a generic "bluetooth" icon

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * power applet: Don't connect to any signals that call _devicesChanged until we have the power proxy (since the callbacks assume we do have it).
  * windowAttentionHandler.js: make the ignored app check case- insensitive.  While we're here make it a gsettings array for convenience.
  * org.cinnamon.gschema.in - add pidgin to ignored wm classes.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Touchpad settings: Invert motion-threshold setting widget

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * appletManager.js: Fix copy/pasting applet panel applet layouts. Extension.get_max_instances() needed an extra argument, and then we were doing work twice - finished removing obsolete code.
  * cinnamon-recorder: fix crash when starting recorder...
  * cinnamon-recorder.c: restore avoidance of the panel when drawing the recording indicators.  This was removed during some panel work a while back and never restored.  Always draw them on the primary monitor now (the only monitor with reliable, simple-to-get workarea information).

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * fix spelling mistakes

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * onscreen keyboard: Add option to change activation behavior - accessible mode has the keyboard appear whenever focus demands it (ordinary accessibility behavior).  On-demand mode will have the keyboard only appear when the user requests it via an applet click or keyboard shortcut.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Themes settings: Fixed loading icon themes when a theme isn't readable

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * popupMenu.js: use the signalManager.disconnect correctly - the source actor (the panel actor for the applet) has to be the second argument, the object to disconnect from.  Was causing flickering in the menu applet after repositioning it.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Makepot
  * Settings: Don't hardcode "more info" link color in spices modules
  * [desrt] network: properly remove connections from list
  * Network applet: Fixed icon not showing VPN status
  * Network applet: Delete trailing spaces
  * Network applet: Fixed applet showing "Auto" wireless connection when turning wifi OFF and then back ON.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * tray icons: Bump icon request to 24, then scale back to 20 in the applet.  This is needed due to changes to GtkIconSize values in Gtk3. GtkStatusIcon iterates thru the built-in icon sizes to pick an appropriate icon to use, and as of 3.18 there are no sizes between 16 and 24px.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Preferred application settings: Set mimetypes more exhaustively

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Background settings: Apply EXIF rotations to thumbnails

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-util.c: cinnamon_util_get_icon_for_uri.c - use a custom icon if one is set in metadata (via file manager).

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Tue, 31 May 2016 09:54:44 +0100

cinnamon (3.0.4) sarah; urgency=medium

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * sound-applet: Fix an icon name

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Ignore accents/stokes when searching the menu or cinnamon-settings
  * Menu applet: Removed trailing spaces
  * Menu applet: Don't refresh twice at the same time.

  [ Lars Mueller ]
  * [Menu applet] Fix not cleared drag placeholder in favorites box This fixes the uncleared drag placeholder in the favorites box, if an application was dragged over, but not dropped on the favorites box This is for #5322

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Mon, 23 May 2016 12:51:41 +0100

cinnamon (3.0.3) sarah; urgency=medium

  [ Dustin Falgout ]
  * Ensure label text is properly escaped before applying it with set_markup() Fixes #5287
  * fix typo

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * SettingsWidgets.py: use a more compatible GFileMonitorFlags - WATCH_MOVES is not available in Mint 17/glib 2.40
  * cinnamon-settings: include module keywords in desktop files
  * cinnamon-app: provide access to desktop file keywords.  Use them in the menu applet search.
  * generated desktop files: re-run, to remove unnecessary comment
  * extensions: Check extensions for unsafe calls (synchronous, etc.. things that can potentially freeze Cinnamon) and make the user aware of them in cinnamon settings.
  * ExtensionCore.py: scan_extension_thread - if the metadata.json file is not found, this must be a versioned xlet, check the parent folder for it instead.
  * cs_power.py: Expose setting to allow lid-closed action even when external monitors are attached.
  * messageTray.js: Don't let notifications with buttons fade on mouse-over.

  [ itzexor ]
  * menu applet: use app id instead of app name for searches prevents duplicate search results for apps with the same desktop entry name when searching with a more specific term
  * sound applet: smplayer: fix artist metadata display and disable seek While seeking does work, after the first time you seek the amount seeked is incorrect. It appears to seek the amount between the beginning of the seek bar and where you released the click instead.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_themes: Add setting for dark theme variant preference.  This is only settable from ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini, so add the ability to modify that as well.
  * cs_effects.py: Expose gtk-overlay-scrollbar setting.

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * cs_sound: Set selection mode to none on the SoundBox() object

  [ NikoKrause ]
  * Missing semicolon
  * Missing semicolon

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Settings: Don't include text/html in the source code mimetypes

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * st-texture-cache.c: use g_themed_icon_new instead of g_themed_icon_new_with_default_fallbacks.

cinnamon (3.0.2) sarah; urgency=medium

  [ ion201 ]
  * Cache generated thumbnails

  [ Lars Mueller ]
  * Fix desktop effects on dialogs and menus This prevents desktop effects on dialogs and menus from being used if desktop-effects is turned off. It's like already like this in the effects settings dialog.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Power applet: Fixed declaration of alias variable
  * Window list: Fixed call on null object

  [ Stephen Collins ]
  * Fix handling of device icon where gicon is None (partially fixes #5248)

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * cinnamon-settings: Don't set the stack switcher to use the main settings stack on creation This is causing visual glitches in a lot of gtk themes when changing from the main icon view to a page that displays the stack switcher

  [ Stephen Collins ]
  * Fix highlighting not working correctly for multiple instances of an applet

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * ExtensionCore.py: Don't break when an xlet provides a bad icon file.

  [ Jason Jackson ]
  * Added null conditional to return empty array when get_devices returns null

  [ brownsr ]
  * correct potential infinite loop

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * accessibility settings: don't use packagekit for now when looking for assistance programs that are installed.  Just look for their binaries, and notify if not installed.  Watch the bin folders in case the user installs the dependency and doesn't restart cinnamon settings.
  * cs_sound.py: Add a close button to the speaker test dialog.

  [ ion201 ]
  * Fix image close crash

 -- Clement Lefebvre <root@linuxmint.com>  Tue, 10 May 2016 16:38:11 +0100

  [ Stephen Collins ]
  * Move sound settings to python as a native module

  * Add a custom page to display when no input devices are available or applications are currently playing. Add a custom settings box for the sound effects page to prevent getting a very tall window when opening the settings. Make a few tweaks to the test sound dialog and add the relevant icons.

  [ Stephen Collins ]
  * Some visual tweaks to the sound settings:
  * Sound settings: add mute to all volume controls

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_sound.py: Few fixes to the volume slider/mute button:
  * layout.js: Remove code for interaction with the screensaver.  It was always broken until 2.8.7, where I 'fixed' it, and has caused some reported regression where the panels will be hidden after returning from the screensaver.

  [ itzexor ]
  * cs_sound.py: add padding to the end of stream names in applications page

  [ s3rj1k ]
  * Viber stealing focus fix

  * Power settings: Fix power bars not being aligned
  * Startup settings: Fix https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/5199

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * tooltips.js: hide if the stage's key focus changes - prevents tooltips from becoming stuck if you use the keyboard to switch focus (hit the menu key while a window list preview is showing.)

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * cs_keyboard: Add a "wide" style class to the pane separator in the shortcuts page and remove some unneeded padding so this looks a little nicer in most newer themes
  * effects: Enable effects on dialogs and menus by default

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Sound applet: Correctly identify changed artwork from Spotify (and add support for new URLs in version 0.27.x)

cinnamon (2.8.7) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_keyboard.py: Fix event handlers for teaching keybindings - the cursor-down and -up keys were being incorrectly used to navigate the tree view during teach mode, and it was breaking focus (and cancelling the teach.)
  * magnifier: limit max zoom to a reasonable value
  * menu applet: Fix vfade in the program list - it was only showing when desktop zoom was turned entirely off.  We've reworked zoom since then, so that the .applications key only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or not - actual zoom activation occurs only when the magnification factor becomes > 1.0.
  * screensaver: Fix proxy to listen to the correct service, fix layout changes when the screensaver starts/stops.
  * layout.js: get an actual boolean from the screensaver proxy.
  * signalManager.js: pass argument array correctly, and don't wipe out this._storage when filtering out disconnected items.

  * Replaced uses of the commands module with subprocess

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * st-container.c: Fix dispose method causing crashes.  priv->children was being updated during destruction of each child, causing invalid pointers when iterating thru priv->children.  Use clutter_actor_destroy_all_children to do just that, and we get no corruption.

  * Alt-tab: Improved preview mode (faster switching animations, less delay, less opacity in the background)
  * Alt-tab: Speed up preview backdrop animation a little more
  * Alt-tab: Classic switcher, don't animate thumbnail removal (it looks weird when switching to the next window..). Also, increase the delay to show thumbs to 300ms. Both 180ms and 300ms seem slow when trying to identify windows by their thumbs, but 180ms gets in the way and shows shadow-thumbs when pressing Alt at "normal" speed. It's all empirical/subjective really.. but this seems to improve things a bit.

  * windowManager: Destroy the tile hud/preview when we are done with it. Currently after showing the preview you will get a noticeable slowdown when moving windows that pass off the monitor edges. This should help solve that.
  * popupMenu: Add back the expander arrow on PopupSubMenuMenuItem but with a different layout. Also tweak the layout of a couple of our applet menus to look nicer with this change. The addition of the icons to Cinnamon itself is a workaround for Mint. Newer versions of the gnome icon theme have these as built in icons but not in the version supplied with Mint 17. They can be removed in the future.

  * window-list applet: restore 2.4 behavior where a window list item demanding attention remains highlighted after it's done flashing.
  * panel-launcher: Use a generic icon when creating a new launcher, if the user didn't select a custom icon.
  * st-widget: Expand the "important" property: add set/get methods, remove CONSTRUCT_ONLY flag, have a theme node recalculation triggered when the property changes.
  * capi.py:  Move with rest of cinnamon-settings files to their new location, remove debian sed rule for multiarch fix, instead figure out the right location in the capi code.  Cinnamon-bluetooth is not MultiarchSpec compliant, so we still need to *also* load from /usr/lib/*.
  * st-widget.c: Fix typo in st_widget_recompute_style
  * st-theme-node: properly recalc the theme node when an StWidget's important property changes.
  * main.js: Fix typo from 08474a03cd660bb176d5ebb361a01ff6d51162fc
  * tooltips.js: Fix some occasional log warnings
  * window list: don't delay showing a preview, if another preview was just showing.
  * keybindings.js: don't tell muffin to remove a keybinding that we never set.  This quiets warnings during startup about magnifier hotkeys.

  * Calendar applet: Avoid unnecessary wakeups
  * Calendar applet: Update each second if global time format is set to include seconds

  * Sound applet: Use the style class .sound-button-container with the pseudo class :small for quit and raise buttons Theme: Apply the :small pseudo class, cleanup of unused sound applet classes
  * Also translate xlet metadata in about dialogs
  * cs-backgrounds: add revealer to gradient widgets when picture-options is set to a value where those have no effect
  * Network applet: hide the switch if the switch has got no function   This is typically the case e.g. when a cable is unplugged
  * trash applet: do not add items to context menu on orientation changed
  * extension.js: Use a macro function to create the Extension.Type members
  * extension.js: xlet uuids are unique for each xlet type, it is now possible to have more than one xlet of different types and the same uuid - Extension.unloadExtension, Extension.forgetExtension and Extension.get_max_instances needs to have a type argument after the uuid - Extension.importObjects, Extension.objects, Extension.meta, Extension.dirs are moved to Extension.Type[type].maps[mapType]
  * Automatically reload xlets when updating them instead of showing an info dialog
  * extension.js: Enable imports in a xlet via import.xlet (where xlet is the type of xlet; applet, desklet, extension or search_provider) cinnamon-js.cpp: Removed cinnamon_js_add_extension_importer
  * appletManager: In arrow filter functions, check if the value exists (when iterating over appletObj) Fixed the bug when the button in applet settings has no effect

  [ Rob Adams ]
  * Show audio device name (origin) in sound applet
  * Change calls to highlight, activate callbacks on xlets - Fixed initial instance not being selected on multi-instance xlets (error on highlight) - Passing uuid and instance_id to cinnamon via dbus - instance_id is the same as uuid when multi-instance not allowed - Corrected order of instance tabs in Gtk.Notebook to reflect order instances were added in

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Renamed Screen Locker settings -> Screensaver and regenerated module desktop files

  * Power settings: Don't rely on output.get_backlight_min|max() to show brightness controls as it's not reliable with all hardware. Try to get backlight() info directly to see if it's supported instead.
  * Theme settings: Fixed regression caused by gettext fix ;)
  * Power settings: Don't show "When the battery is critically low" option with upower 1.0 (it no longer supports that)
  * Power settings: Don't use variables that don't exist (in UPS handling)
  * Calendar applet: Refresh view when show-week-numbers setting is changed
  * Network applet: Properly detect active VPN connection at session start when updating the panel icon
  * On-Screen keyboard: Affect Struts
  * On-Screen keyboard: Removed transparent background in default theme.
  * Sound applet: Only read position for seek-supported players, only support seek when playback rate is 1.0, don't support seek for Totem/GNOME-MPlayer/Pithos (either getting or setting the position isn't fully functional), only update the position timer once every second
  * Systray applet: Factorize icon resize code, removed special cases (we know they don't work for pidgin and thunderbird)

  * cinnamon-settings: invert mouse sensitivity setting so it makes sense, eliminate rubber-banding of GSettingsRange by restricting int setting types to whole number adjustments in the slider.
  * cs_privacy: replace broken unbind() - take advantage of the behavior that a new binding will overwrite a previous one on the same object property.
  * Add image for default screensaver preview.
  * cs_screensaver.py: bring the currently selected screensaver row into view when the panel is displayed.
  * menu applet: when refreshing happens, apps, recent and places need to end up in the same order as before.  Also, since we empty the whole container during an app refresh, we need to rebuild recent and places.  When places change, we need to refresh recent also (to maintain order).
  * SettingsWidgets: display the correct number of SpinButton digits depending on the step value. (fixes issue with font scale spinner)

  * Settings: Fix occasional GTK-Warning and blank menu entry in the terminal selection, some comments
  * overrides: only check gsettings schema when it's actually provided.
  * magnifier.js: fix source id warning
  * notifications: fix default opacity being doubled in hidpi mode.
  * desklets: Make sure a new desklet is placed in a visible portion of the primary monitor.
  * photo desklet: Fix a warning, clock desklet: move some String class overrides to js/ui/overrides.js so they can be used in the desklet as well as the calendar applet.
  * panel applet: always remove the drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * menu applet: always remove a favorites drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * Added missing dependency on gir1.2-notify-0.7
  * Cinnamon Settings: Properly handle themes which thumbnail isn't readable
  * cinnamon-slideshow: fix introspection for some Fixes #3742
  * fix user added picture slideshow
  * fix 'genericpath.py:29:isfile:TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found'
  * sound applet: fixed #3735 - mute on middle click
  * windowManager.js: Fix opacity issues when using fade mapping, and other effects involving opacity changes.
  * cinnamon-settings keyboard: fix Escape key handling to cancel keybinding teach mode (when numlock is on), and allow backspace to be used as a hotkey when modified.
  * keybindings: Ignore capslock for teach mode
  * keybindings: force lower case when comparing existing keybindings for collisions.
  * Fixed scroll direction in window list applet
  * layout.js: don't hide/show the panels during the startup animation, make them temporarily transparent instead - this fixes an issue when panel auto-hide is active, the animation will complete, and you'll see a temporary blank area where the panel would be, as the chrome adjusts to the panel.
  * layout.js: Only alter panel behavior during animation when the panel auto-hide is actually active - it 'looks' better during startup for any non-auto-hidden panel.
  * appletManager.js: Don't dump orphaned applets into the remaining panel when changing layouts from double to single panel.  They are silently ignored. They will show as having an issue in applet settings (red dot) and a looking glass log note, describing how to fix, if desired.
  * keybindings: Filter out reserved GdkModifierTypes - they can interfere with keybindings on certain systems.
  * classicSwitcher.js: prevent warning from an errant source id.
  * app switcher:  Fix double-destroy when activating a minimized window. The app switchers listen for the 'map' signal from windows - a mapping signal triggers an _activateWindow, and we also get an activate from actually selecting the window in the first place.
  * st-im-text.c: Fix capslock in StEntry widgets.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Fix warning from invalid source id.
  * overrides.js: Add dump_stack when .disconnecting with an invalid ID.
  * classicSwitcher.js: Force a re-allocation of the alt-tab container when a thumbnail/preview is removed.
  * Fixed default avatar image path
  * menu applet: Don't reset the category when dragging an app.
  * st-texture-cache.c: Make sure the pixbuf requested ends up with the correct-sized texture (instead of the original texture size) - StIcon's update_shadow_material method was getting a bad size to generate the shadow/blur.
  * Rename the stock cinnamon menu applet icon so it gets rendered correctly as a symbolic icon.
  * applet.js: Make sure set_applet_icon_symbolic_name and _path use a good size when scale mode is off.  Also reduce the padding of the menu-symbolic.svg icon so its visible size is more in line with other symbolic icons.
  * menu applet: Fix logic surrounding the default icon.
  * Fixed the PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
  * Cinnamon Settings: Fixed menu picture sizes in PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
