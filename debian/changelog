cinnamon (2.8.0) rosa; urgency=medium

  [ Alexandre Rostovtsev ]
  * build: require libmuffin-2.5.0 for show_tile_preview
  * build: append ST_CFLAGS when building test-recorder

  [ Asier Iturralde Sarasola ]
  * Fix some typos in the Writing applets tutorial

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Power applet: Fix case when last battery is removed (applet continued to show up)
  * Power settings/applet: Added vendor/model info, refactored code/logic as to which device to show in the applet, fixed 6px margin issue
  * Power applet: Don't show time until fully charged when equal to 0 (i.e. when unknown)
  * Multi-monitor support: When switching workspace, the workspace name OSD should appear on all relevant monitors
  * Alt-tab: Improved preview mode (faster switching animations, less delay, less opacity in the background)
  * Alt-tab: Speed up preview backdrop animation a little more
  * Alt-tab: Classic switcher, don't animate thumbnail removal (it looks weird when switching to the next window..). Also, increase the delay to show thumbs to 300ms. Both 180ms and 300ms seem slow when trying to identify windows by their thumbs, but 180ms gets in the way and shows shadow-thumbs when pressing Alt at "normal" speed. It's all empirical/subjective really.. but this seems to improve things a bit.
  * Display applet: Show output names (handy when the the display name is the same for 2 or more monitors)
  * Workspace Switcher applet: Added visual representations and configuration to switch between visual and button modes

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * Deprecations: Remove use of deprecated g_type_init () and bump GObject requirement accordingly.
  * Deprecations: Replace gtk_icon_info_free() with g_object_unref()
  * Cleanup: instead of attempting to clean up deprecated functionality in cinnamon-arrow, just remove it since it seems to be unused.
  * Cleanup: Fix an unused function warning in cinnamon-global.c
  * Cleanup: Remove st-tooltip. It's the source of a lot of build warnings and we no longer use it.
  * js: Explicitly dispose of all cairo contexts. A long read on why you want to do this here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=685513

  * workspace-switcher: Add an "Add new workspace" option to the context menu
  * boxpointer: Pull in some upstream fixes that better handle the boxpointer "arrow" in some cases
  * Set the X-Gnome-AutoRestart hint to false. Stumbled across this in an old gnome bug report. Fixes the issue with Cinnamon restarting twice with cinnamon --replace
  * windowManager: Destroy the tile hud/preview when we are done with it. Currently after showing the preview you will get a noticeable slowdown when moving windows that pass off the monitor edges. This should help solve that.
  * popupMenu: Add back the expander arrow on PopupSubMenuMenuItem but with a different layout. Also tweak the layout of a couple of our applet menus to look nicer with this change. The addition of the icons to Cinnamon itself is a workaround for Mint. Newer versions of the gnome icon theme have these as built in icons but not in the version supplied with Mint 17. They can be removed in the future.
  * bg: add "spanned" to the list of bg types that need to show the background color options
  * popupMenu: add back a couple checks for the existence of submenu expander arrow to prevent breaking the right click context menus in the menu applet
  * use the new meta_screen_get_current_monitor() to place appswitchers and modal dialogs on the proper monitor in multiple monitor setups
  * workspace-applet: properly dispose a cairo context
  * cs_windows: Reword a setting to match https://github.com/linuxmint/muffin/pull/204
  * windowManager: Make the window dimming effect with attached dialogs a bit stronger and more obvious
  * windowManager: Properly declare a variable
  * add new slider and separator objects
  * workspace-switcher: Rework the visual style workspace switcher so it can be themed. Also fix some st_theme_node warnings and stop windows from being able to be drawn outside the workspace background
  * cs_startup: set modal to true for both the "Choose application" and "Add custom command" dialogs so the behavior is the same for both when using attached dialogs
  * rework the window list and effects so minimize effects work properly with multiple window lists on multiple monitors
  * sound-applet: make the volume slider for individual applications fully expand

  * window-list applet: restore 2.4 behavior where a window list item demanding attention remains highlighted after it's done flashing.
  * panel-launcher: Use a generic icon when creating a new launcher, if the user didn't select a custom icon.
  * st-widget: Expand the "important" property: add set/get methods, remove CONSTRUCT_ONLY flag, have a theme node recalculation triggered when the property changes.
  * capi.py:  Move with rest of cinnamon-settings files to their new location, remove debian sed rule for multiarch fix, instead figure out the right location in the capi code.  Cinnamon-bluetooth is not MultiarchSpec compliant, so we still need to *also* load from /usr/lib/*.
  * st-widget.c: Fix typo in st_widget_recompute_style
  * st-theme-node: properly recalc the theme node when an StWidget's important property changes.
  * main.js: Fix typo from 08474a03cd660bb176d5ebb361a01ff6d51162fc
  * tooltips.js: Fix some occasional log warnings
  * window list: don't delay showing a preview, if another preview was just showing.

  * Also translate xlet metadata in about dialogs
  * cs-backgrounds: add revealer to gradient widgets when picture-options is set to a value where those have no effect
  * Network applet: hide the switch if the switch has got no function   This is typically the case e.g. when a cable is unplugged
  * trash applet: do not add items to context menu on orientation changed
  * extension.js: Use a macro function to create the Extension.Type members
  * extension.js: xlet uuids are unique for each xlet type, it is now possible to have more than one xlet of different types and the same uuid - Extension.unloadExtension, Extension.forgetExtension and Extension.get_max_instances needs to have a type argument after the uuid - Extension.importObjects, Extension.objects, Extension.meta, Extension.dirs are moved to Extension.Type[type].maps[mapType]
  * Automatically reload xlets when updating them instead of showing an info dialog
  * extension.js: Enable imports in a xlet via import.xlet (where xlet is the type of xlet; applet, desklet, extension or search_provider) cinnamon-js.cpp: Removed cinnamon_js_add_extension_importer
  * appletManager: In arrow filter functions, check if the value exists (when iterating over appletObj) Fixed the bug when the button in applet settings has no effect

  * Power settings: Don't rely on output.get_backlight_min|max() to show brightness controls as it's not reliable with all hardware. Try to get backlight() info directly to see if it's supported instead.
  * Theme settings: Fixed regression caused by gettext fix ;)
  * Power settings: Don't show "When the battery is critically low" option with upower 1.0 (it no longer supports that)

  * overrides: only check gsettings schema when it's actually provided.
  * magnifier.js: fix source id warning
  * notifications: fix default opacity being doubled in hidpi mode.
  * desklets: Make sure a new desklet is placed in a visible portion of the primary monitor.
  * photo desklet: Fix a warning, clock desklet: move some String class overrides to js/ui/overrides.js so they can be used in the desklet as well as the calendar applet.
  * panel applet: always remove the drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * menu applet: always remove a favorites drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)

  * windowManager.js: Fix opacity issues when using fade mapping, and other effects involving opacity changes.
  * cinnamon-settings keyboard: fix Escape key handling to cancel keybinding teach mode (when numlock is on), and allow backspace to be used as a hotkey when modified.
  * keybindings: Ignore capslock for teach mode
  * keybindings: force lower case when comparing existing keybindings for collisions.
  * Fixed scroll direction in window list applet
  * layout.js: don't hide/show the panels during the startup animation, make them temporarily transparent instead - this fixes an issue when panel auto-hide is active, the animation will complete, and you'll see a temporary blank area where the panel would be, as the chrome adjusts to the panel.
  * layout.js: Only alter panel behavior during animation when the panel auto-hide is actually active - it 'looks' better during startup for any non-auto-hidden panel.
  * appletManager.js: Don't dump orphaned applets into the remaining panel when changing layouts from double to single panel.  They are silently ignored. They will show as having an issue in applet settings (red dot) and a looking glass log note, describing how to fix, if desired.
  * keybindings: Filter out reserved GdkModifierTypes - they can interfere with keybindings on certain systems.
  * classicSwitcher.js: prevent warning from an errant source id.
  * app switcher:  Fix double-destroy when activating a minimized window. The app switchers listen for the 'map' signal from windows - a mapping signal triggers an _activateWindow, and we also get an activate from actually selecting the window in the first place.
  * st-im-text.c: Fix capslock in StEntry widgets.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Fix warning from invalid source id.
  * overrides.js: Add dump_stack when .disconnecting with an invalid ID.
  * classicSwitcher.js: Force a re-allocation of the alt-tab container when a thumbnail/preview is removed.
  * Fixed default avatar image path
  * menu applet: Don't reset the category when dragging an app.
  * st-texture-cache.c: Make sure the pixbuf requested ends up with the correct-sized texture (instead of the original texture size) - StIcon's update_shadow_material method was getting a bad size to generate the shadow/blur.

  * applet.js: Make sure set_applet_icon_symbolic_name and _path use a good size when scale mode is off.  Also reduce the padding of the menu-symbolic.svg icon so its visible size is more in line with other symbolic icons.
  * menu applet: Fix logic surrounding the default icon.
  * Fixed the PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
  * Cinnamon Settings: Fixed menu picture sizes in PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
