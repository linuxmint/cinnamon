  * Simplify how applet positions are saved after a dnd operation and allow extra properties to be added to a definition in the enabled-applets key
  * Improve the way cinnamon handles applets that are added to an unsupported panel. Previously, Cinnamon would send a message to cinnamon-settings saying there was an error. With this change, the user is now prompted with the following options: 1. Leave the applet on the panel anyway (some applets are still suitable for vertical panels under certain circumstances - even if they aren't marked as such). In this case an override is added to the applet definition to avoid the user being prompted in the future. 2. Remove the applet. 3. Try to move the applet to a different panel. If a suitable panel cannot be found, the applet is removed instead.

  * st-texture-cache.c: don't cache st_texture_cache_load_from_raw - its only user is the notificationDaemon.  These are transient images that were being stored in the cache that would never be evicted during theme changes (this does not just mean times when the user changed the icon them.)

  * cinnamon-settings-users: Restrict the size of user images, as they are displayed in the right view when a user is selected.  If the image at /var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user> is set to a ridiculously-sized image, it won't break the ui.
  * cs_user: Don't let large images break the ui - make sure we scale the selected image to an appropriate size.  Also, don't crop user-selected images (but keep cropping webcam images) - it's strange to select an image file and have the ends of it cut off.

  * window-list: bring space around preview down and correct a calculation problem beta testing user asked for the space around the window preview to be brought in a bit that in turn highlighted a bug where the scaling was calculated without taking the icon+title into effect I've brought the spare space down a bit, but I can't bring it down further and have it look right in all themes without major surgery, which would be best done in a development cycle.  The space allowance for the icon is not fully adequate as the title font could be set large, and so take up more room than the icon. But I've tried with this height adjustment and this scaling across a wide selection of themes, and it appears to stand up.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings-users, cs-user, ChooserButtonWidgets: let GdkPixbuf do the work of restricting the size of images while maintaining aspect ratio.  Follow-up to last few commits.
  * StScrollView: queue redraws whenever the adjustments change, to prevent artifacts outside of the view itself.
  * StScrollView: More effective way of fixing the graphical artifacts generated during scrolling.  This also appears to fix some unrelated tearing issues I was seeing in the menu while testing.
  * main.c: Own onboard's dbus name to prevent it starting when gnome's a11y keyboard settings key is active (org.gnome.desktop.a11y.applications screen-keyboard-enabled.) Also own caribou's daemon.  Caribou's OSK won't interfere in a Cinnamon session, but its daemon will run needlessly in the background otherwise.

  * network applet: Remove a useless log warning.  At some point more than a year ago we started getting these (possibly a change to network-manager), they have no value whatsoever, but fill up the log.

And don't re-make the GtkSocket every time - connecting to socket's plug-removed and returning True prevents the socket from auto-destructing and also improves cleanup when changing row selection.

  * show desktop applet: keep track of peek timeout id
  * show desktop applet: various cleanups

  [ brownsr ]
  * Correct drag and drop bugs in panel launcher 1) an issue that looks to have been there before the vertical panels change where    drag and drop within the panel launcher would drop icons in unscaled rather    than at the same scale as the other icons 2) a vertical panels issue where the drag and drop code was assuming horizontal orientation    and so was calculating both the position in the list of icons and the new position in the    actor incorrectly 3) took the opportunity to correct a number of minor indentation issues
  * correct window list internal drag and drop for vertical panels 1) The override on the allowable drag direction was not set to allow vertical dragging    also previous override needed clearing when orientation changed 2) Removed a few stray tabs etc. 3) Calculated the drop position correctly for vertical panels

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * keyboard applet: restore upper-case option, fix regression from xlet settings revamp.

  [ brownsr ]
  * workspace switcher - change whether graph is shown or not At the moment the graph is suppressed in vertical panels because a long wide workspace resulting from multiple monitors results in an unworkable graph when scaled to fit the panel width. Change this to test on the workspace size ratio, as this will permit single monitor setups to have the workspace graph
  * add vertical style class to workspace switcher No code is needed to remove it as buttons are rebuilt from scratch when panels are moved between orientations. Linked to a change to improve appearance of this applet in vertical panels in Mint-X themes

  [ NikoKrause ]
  * [menu-applet] decodeUriComponent in placesManager.js and docInfo.js

  [ brownsr ]
  * refactor if sequence to case statement, and sort alignment

  [ NikoKrause ]
  * added PopupSwitchIconMenuItem and used it in sound-applet

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cinnamon-settings: On widgets that don't use bind functions, connect to the widget changed handlers only after setting their initial value.  This prevents on_settings_changed() from being triggered right away, as well as a subsequent trigger of the widget changed handler (for a second time.)

  [ brownsr ]
  * make accessibility applet suitable for vertical panels The issue is that sticky keys make use of the applet label to display and this is not compatible with a vertical panel.

  [ JosephMcc ]
  * panel.js: Change the order which panels are drawn

  [ itzexor ]
  * cs_screensaver.py: expose new cinnamon screensaver settings
  * cinnamon-settings.py: refactor maybe_resize slightly

  [ brownsr ]
  * ensure applets that override on_panel_height_changed  get to scale properly The logic in the common applet code has been changed so that the scaling is not overridden by the locally overridden function.  The local function thus becomes additional to the core function, rather than overriding it in its entirety. This also corrects errors associated with turning scale mode on and off. One more associated change to the window-list applet in a vertical panel will be needed but as there are changes queued up for that I think it's best done subsequently fixes #5700
  * Ensure that the edge of the screen reacts to mouse clicks Previously the outside couple of pixels were unreactive.  This was set so as to avoid recursion errors but these seem no longer to be there, so this resets to the desired behaviour

  [ itzexor ]

  * Add a generic "bluetooth" icon

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * power applet: Don't connect to any signals that call _devicesChanged until we have the power proxy (since the callbacks assume we do have it).
  * windowAttentionHandler.js: make the ignored app check case- insensitive.  While we're here make it a gsettings array for convenience.
  * org.cinnamon.gschema.in - add pidgin to ignored wm classes.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Touchpad settings: Invert motion-threshold setting widget

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * appletManager.js: Fix copy/pasting applet panel applet layouts. Extension.get_max_instances() needed an extra argument, and then we were doing work twice - finished removing obsolete code.
  * cinnamon-recorder: fix crash when starting recorder...
  * cinnamon-recorder.c: restore avoidance of the panel when drawing the recording indicators.  This was removed during some panel work a while back and never restored.  Always draw them on the primary monitor now (the only monitor with reliable, simple-to-get workarea information).

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * fix spelling mistakes

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * onscreen keyboard: Add option to change activation behavior - accessible mode has the keyboard appear whenever focus demands it (ordinary accessibility behavior).  On-demand mode will have the keyboard only appear when the user requests it via an applet click or keyboard shortcut.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Themes settings: Fixed loading icon themes when a theme isn't readable

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * popupMenu.js: use the signalManager.disconnect correctly - the source actor (the panel actor for the applet) has to be the second argument, the object to disconnect from.  Was causing flickering in the menu applet after repositioning it.

  * Makepot
  * Settings: Don't hardcode "more info" link color in spices modules
  * [desrt] network: properly remove connections from list
  * Network applet: Fixed icon not showing VPN status

  * Network applet: Fixed applet showing "Auto" wireless connection when turning wifi OFF and then back ON.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * tray icons: Bump icon request to 24, then scale back to 20 in the applet.  This is needed due to changes to GtkIconSize values in Gtk3. GtkStatusIcon iterates thru the built-in icon sizes to pick an appropriate icon to use, and as of 3.18 there are no sizes between 16 and 24px.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_keyboard.py: Fix event handlers for teaching keybindings - the cursor-down and -up keys were being incorrectly used to navigate the tree view during teach mode, and it was breaking focus (and cancelling the teach.)
  * magnifier: limit max zoom to a reasonable value
  * menu applet: Fix vfade in the program list - it was only showing when desktop zoom was turned entirely off.  We've reworked zoom since then, so that the .applications key only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or not - actual zoom activation occurs only when the magnification factor becomes > 1.0.
  * screensaver: Fix proxy to listen to the correct service, fix layout changes when the screensaver starts/stops.

  * Alt-tab: Speed up preview backdrop animation a little more
  * Alt-tab: Classic switcher, don't animate thumbnail removal (it looks weird when switching to the next window..). Also, increase the delay to show thumbs to 300ms. Both 180ms and 300ms seem slow when trying to identify windows by their thumbs, but 180ms gets in the way and shows shadow-thumbs when pressing Alt at "normal" speed. It's all empirical/subjective really.. but this seems to improve things a bit.

  * popupMenu: Add back the expander arrow on PopupSubMenuMenuItem but with a different layout. Also tweak the layout of a couple of our applet menus to look nicer with this change. The addition of the icons to Cinnamon itself is a workaround for Mint. Newer versions of the gnome icon theme have these as built in icons but not in the version supplied with Mint 17. They can be removed in the future.

  * capi.py:  Move with rest of cinnamon-settings files to their new location, remove debian sed rule for multiarch fix, instead figure out the right location in the capi code.  Cinnamon-bluetooth is not MultiarchSpec compliant, so we still need to *also* load from /usr/lib/*.

  * Automatically reload xlets when updating them instead of showing an info dialog
  * extension.js: Enable imports in a xlet via import.xlet (where xlet is the type of xlet; applet, desklet, extension or search_provider) cinnamon-js.cpp: Removed cinnamon_js_add_extension_importer
  * appletManager: In arrow filter functions, check if the value exists (when iterating over appletObj) Fixed the bug when the button in applet settings has no effect

  [ Rob Adams ]
  * Show audio device name (origin) in sound applet
  * Change calls to highlight, activate callbacks on xlets - Fixed initial instance not being selected on multi-instance xlets (error on highlight) - Passing uuid and instance_id to cinnamon via dbus - instance_id is the same as uuid when multi-instance not allowed - Corrected order of instance tabs in Gtk.Notebook to reflect order instances were added in

  * Power settings: Don't rely on output.get_backlight_min|max() to show brightness controls as it's not reliable with all hardware. Try to get backlight() info directly to see if it's supported instead.
  * Theme settings: Fixed regression caused by gettext fix ;)
  * Power settings: Don't show "When the battery is critically low" option with upower 1.0 (it no longer supports that)
  * Power settings: Don't use variables that don't exist (in UPS handling)
  * Calendar applet: Refresh view when show-week-numbers setting is changed
  * Network applet: Properly detect active VPN connection at session start when updating the panel icon
  * On-Screen keyboard: Affect Struts
  * On-Screen keyboard: Removed transparent background in default theme.
  * Sound applet: Only read position for seek-supported players, only support seek when playback rate is 1.0, don't support seek for Totem/GNOME-MPlayer/Pithos (either getting or setting the position isn't fully functional), only update the position timer once every second
  * Systray applet: Factorize icon resize code, removed special cases (we know they don't work for pidgin and thunderbird)

  * cinnamon-settings: invert mouse sensitivity setting so it makes sense, eliminate rubber-banding of GSettingsRange by restricting int setting types to whole number adjustments in the slider.
  * cs_privacy: replace broken unbind() - take advantage of the behavior that a new binding will overwrite a previous one on the same object property.
  * Add image for default screensaver preview.
  * cs_screensaver.py: bring the currently selected screensaver row into view when the panel is displayed.
  * menu applet: when refreshing happens, apps, recent and places need to end up in the same order as before.  Also, since we empty the whole container during an app refresh, we need to rebuild recent and places.  When places change, we need to refresh recent also (to maintain order).
  * SettingsWidgets: display the correct number of SpinButton digits depending on the step value. (fixes issue with font scale spinner)

  * Settings: Fix occasional GTK-Warning and blank menu entry in the terminal selection, some comments
  * overrides: only check gsettings schema when it's actually provided.
  * magnifier.js: fix source id warning
  * notifications: fix default opacity being doubled in hidpi mode.
  * desklets: Make sure a new desklet is placed in a visible portion of the primary monitor.
  * photo desklet: Fix a warning, clock desklet: move some String class overrides to js/ui/overrides.js so they can be used in the desklet as well as the calendar applet.
  * panel applet: always remove the drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * menu applet: always remove a favorites drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * Added missing dependency on gir1.2-notify-0.7
  * Cinnamon Settings: Properly handle themes which thumbnail isn't readable
  * cinnamon-slideshow: fix introspection for some Fixes #3742
  * fix user added picture slideshow
  * fix 'genericpath.py:29:isfile:TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found'
  * sound applet: fixed #3735 - mute on middle click
  * windowManager.js: Fix opacity issues when using fade mapping, and other effects involving opacity changes.
  * cinnamon-settings keyboard: fix Escape key handling to cancel keybinding teach mode (when numlock is on), and allow backspace to be used as a hotkey when modified.
  * keybindings: Ignore capslock for teach mode
  * keybindings: force lower case when comparing existing keybindings for collisions.
  * Fixed scroll direction in window list applet
  * layout.js: don't hide/show the panels during the startup animation, make them temporarily transparent instead - this fixes an issue when panel auto-hide is active, the animation will complete, and you'll see a temporary blank area where the panel would be, as the chrome adjusts to the panel.
  * layout.js: Only alter panel behavior during animation when the panel auto-hide is actually active - it 'looks' better during startup for any non-auto-hidden panel.
  * appletManager.js: Don't dump orphaned applets into the remaining panel when changing layouts from double to single panel.  They are silently ignored. They will show as having an issue in applet settings (red dot) and a looking glass log note, describing how to fix, if desired.
  * keybindings: Filter out reserved GdkModifierTypes - they can interfere with keybindings on certain systems.
  * classicSwitcher.js: prevent warning from an errant source id.
  * app switcher:  Fix double-destroy when activating a minimized window. The app switchers listen for the 'map' signal from windows - a mapping signal triggers an _activateWindow, and we also get an activate from actually selecting the window in the first place.
  * st-im-text.c: Fix capslock in StEntry widgets.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Fix warning from invalid source id.
  * overrides.js: Add dump_stack when .disconnecting with an invalid ID.
  * classicSwitcher.js: Force a re-allocation of the alt-tab container when a thumbnail/preview is removed.
  * Fixed default avatar image path
  * menu applet: Don't reset the category when dragging an app.
  * st-texture-cache.c: Make sure the pixbuf requested ends up with the correct-sized texture (instead of the original texture size) - StIcon's update_shadow_material method was getting a bad size to generate the shadow/blur.
  * Rename the stock cinnamon menu applet icon so it gets rendered correctly as a symbolic icon.
  * applet.js: Make sure set_applet_icon_symbolic_name and _path use a good size when scale mode is off.  Also reduce the padding of the menu-symbolic.svg icon so its visible size is more in line with other symbolic icons.
  * menu applet: Fix logic surrounding the default icon.
  * Fixed the PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
  * Cinnamon Settings: Fixed menu picture sizes in PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
