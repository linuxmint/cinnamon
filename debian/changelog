  * cs_sound.py: Few fixes to the volume slider/mute button:

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * cs_keyboard.py: Fix event handlers for teaching keybindings - the cursor-down and -up keys were being incorrectly used to navigate the tree view during teach mode, and it was breaking focus (and cancelling the teach.)
  * magnifier: limit max zoom to a reasonable value
  * menu applet: Fix vfade in the program list - it was only showing when desktop zoom was turned entirely off.  We've reworked zoom since then, so that the .applications key only determines whether we listen to key and mouse bindings or not - actual zoom activation occurs only when the magnification factor becomes > 1.0.
  * screensaver: Fix proxy to listen to the correct service, fix layout changes when the screensaver starts/stops.
  * layout.js: get an actual boolean from the screensaver proxy.
  * signalManager.js: pass argument array correctly, and don't wipe out this._storage when filtering out disconnected items.

  * Alt-tab: Speed up preview backdrop animation a little more
  * Alt-tab: Classic switcher, don't animate thumbnail removal (it looks weird when switching to the next window..). Also, increase the delay to show thumbs to 300ms. Both 180ms and 300ms seem slow when trying to identify windows by their thumbs, but 180ms gets in the way and shows shadow-thumbs when pressing Alt at "normal" speed. It's all empirical/subjective really.. but this seems to improve things a bit.

  * popupMenu: Add back the expander arrow on PopupSubMenuMenuItem but with a different layout. Also tweak the layout of a couple of our applet menus to look nicer with this change. The addition of the icons to Cinnamon itself is a workaround for Mint. Newer versions of the gnome icon theme have these as built in icons but not in the version supplied with Mint 17. They can be removed in the future.

  * capi.py:  Move with rest of cinnamon-settings files to their new location, remove debian sed rule for multiarch fix, instead figure out the right location in the capi code.  Cinnamon-bluetooth is not MultiarchSpec compliant, so we still need to *also* load from /usr/lib/*.

  * extension.js: Enable imports in a xlet via import.xlet (where xlet is the type of xlet; applet, desklet, extension or search_provider) cinnamon-js.cpp: Removed cinnamon_js_add_extension_importer
  * appletManager: In arrow filter functions, check if the value exists (when iterating over appletObj) Fixed the bug when the button in applet settings has no effect

  [ Rob Adams ]
  * Show audio device name (origin) in sound applet
  * Change calls to highlight, activate callbacks on xlets - Fixed initial instance not being selected on multi-instance xlets (error on highlight) - Passing uuid and instance_id to cinnamon via dbus - instance_id is the same as uuid when multi-instance not allowed - Corrected order of instance tabs in Gtk.Notebook to reflect order instances were added in

  * Theme settings: Fixed regression caused by gettext fix ;)
  * Power settings: Don't show "When the battery is critically low" option with upower 1.0 (it no longer supports that)
  * Power settings: Don't use variables that don't exist (in UPS handling)
  * Calendar applet: Refresh view when show-week-numbers setting is changed
  * Network applet: Properly detect active VPN connection at session start when updating the panel icon
  * On-Screen keyboard: Affect Struts
  * On-Screen keyboard: Removed transparent background in default theme.
  * Sound applet: Only read position for seek-supported players, only support seek when playback rate is 1.0, don't support seek for Totem/GNOME-MPlayer/Pithos (either getting or setting the position isn't fully functional), only update the position timer once every second
  * Systray applet: Factorize icon resize code, removed special cases (we know they don't work for pidgin and thunderbird)

  * cs_privacy: replace broken unbind() - take advantage of the behavior that a new binding will overwrite a previous one on the same object property.
  * Add image for default screensaver preview.
  * cs_screensaver.py: bring the currently selected screensaver row into view when the panel is displayed.
  * menu applet: when refreshing happens, apps, recent and places need to end up in the same order as before.  Also, since we empty the whole container during an app refresh, we need to rebuild recent and places.  When places change, we need to refresh recent also (to maintain order).
  * SettingsWidgets: display the correct number of SpinButton digits depending on the step value. (fixes issue with font scale spinner)

  * Settings: Fix occasional GTK-Warning and blank menu entry in the terminal selection, some comments
  * overrides: only check gsettings schema when it's actually provided.
  * magnifier.js: fix source id warning
  * notifications: fix default opacity being doubled in hidpi mode.
  * desklets: Make sure a new desklet is placed in a visible portion of the primary monitor.
  * photo desklet: Fix a warning, clock desklet: move some String class overrides to js/ui/overrides.js so they can be used in the desklet as well as the calendar applet.
  * panel applet: always remove the drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * menu applet: always remove a favorites drag placeholder after a drag (not just after a successful one)
  * Added missing dependency on gir1.2-notify-0.7
  * Cinnamon Settings: Properly handle themes which thumbnail isn't readable
  * cinnamon-slideshow: fix introspection for some Fixes #3742
  * fix user added picture slideshow
  * fix 'genericpath.py:29:isfile:TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found'
  * sound applet: fixed #3735 - mute on middle click
  * windowManager.js: Fix opacity issues when using fade mapping, and other effects involving opacity changes.
  * cinnamon-settings keyboard: fix Escape key handling to cancel keybinding teach mode (when numlock is on), and allow backspace to be used as a hotkey when modified.
  * keybindings: Ignore capslock for teach mode
  * keybindings: force lower case when comparing existing keybindings for collisions.
  * Fixed scroll direction in window list applet
  * layout.js: don't hide/show the panels during the startup animation, make them temporarily transparent instead - this fixes an issue when panel auto-hide is active, the animation will complete, and you'll see a temporary blank area where the panel would be, as the chrome adjusts to the panel.
  * layout.js: Only alter panel behavior during animation when the panel auto-hide is actually active - it 'looks' better during startup for any non-auto-hidden panel.
  * appletManager.js: Don't dump orphaned applets into the remaining panel when changing layouts from double to single panel.  They are silently ignored. They will show as having an issue in applet settings (red dot) and a looking glass log note, describing how to fix, if desired.
  * keybindings: Filter out reserved GdkModifierTypes - they can interfere with keybindings on certain systems.
  * classicSwitcher.js: prevent warning from an errant source id.
  * app switcher:  Fix double-destroy when activating a minimized window. The app switchers listen for the 'map' signal from windows - a mapping signal triggers an _activateWindow, and we also get an activate from actually selecting the window in the first place.
  * st-im-text.c: Fix capslock in StEntry widgets.
  * expoThumbnail.js: Fix warning from invalid source id.
  * overrides.js: Add dump_stack when .disconnecting with an invalid ID.
  * classicSwitcher.js: Force a re-allocation of the alt-tab container when a thumbnail/preview is removed.
  * Fixed default avatar image path
  * menu applet: Don't reset the category when dragging an app.
  * st-texture-cache.c: Make sure the pixbuf requested ends up with the correct-sized texture (instead of the original texture size) - StIcon's update_shadow_material method was getting a bad size to generate the shadow/blur.
  * Rename the stock cinnamon menu applet icon so it gets rendered correctly as a symbolic icon.
  * applet.js: Make sure set_applet_icon_symbolic_name and _path use a good size when scale mode is off.  Also reduce the padding of the menu-symbolic.svg icon so its visible size is more in line with other symbolic icons.
  * menu applet: Fix logic surrounding the default icon.
  * Fixed the PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
  * Cinnamon Settings: Fixed menu picture sizes in PictureChooserButton in Gtk 3.14, compatible with 3.10.
