Fixes needed
------------
 - Administration and preference don't appear in menu editor
 - Move up and Move down buttons don't work in menu editor (if Gnome 3 broke that we need to switch back to the GTK2 version of this tool, as on the original fork)
 - Don't hide spotify in systray
 - Conky/mintupload windows appear (careful not to hide gimp utility windows though or make it configurable)
 - workspaces can overlap in expo grid 
 - recommend muffin
 - depend on gsjdbus
 - muffin should depend on libmuffin0 and gir-muffin of the same version (currently it's possible to upgrade cinnamon and libmuffin without upgrading other muffin packages and it results in crashes)
 - Alt-arrow shortcuts don't work in nemo
