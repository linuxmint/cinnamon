FIX NEEDED FOR 1.6.x
--------------------

 - A user reported problems with Muffin 1.1.0 (and previously also in cinnamon 1.4/muffin 1.0.x) that work fine in Mutter 3.4.1-0ubuntu1: constant flickering with some graphics-heavy applications, especially games, and overheating. There's probably a fix in Mutter or a change in clutter we need to take into account. 

NEMO
----

 - Add gtk bookmarks to right-click->copy-to/move-to

TODO
----

 - i18n: Update translations
 - i18n: Localize menu categories 
 - Applets: Fix power applet appearing when applets are moved (code refactoring needed)
 - System: Fallback on Metacity when Cinnamon crashes
 - System: Improve logging (capture stderr output into log files)
 - Applet API: Allow applets to provide a gsettings schema (which cinnamon-settings compiles when the applet is installed)
 - Settings: Fix settings moved to gsettings since 3.4 changes in cinnamon-settings
 - Settings: In Cinnamon Settings, add the ability to delete themes, extensions and applets located in the user's home
 - Settings: In Cinnamon Settings, add the ability to view and install themes, extensions and applets from cinnamon-settings
 - Layout: Give Cinnamon WM tiling features (fill, grid..etc).
 - Fix menu crashing Cinnamon (show a category, Internet for instance, click elsewhere, open a terminal, install a program in that category, Opera for instance, open the menu)
 - Fix tooltips on GTK popups appearing behind the popups (and move tooltips when they appear on top of the panel)
 - Fix https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/767 
 - Add one-hand keyboard-shortcuts for scale and expo
