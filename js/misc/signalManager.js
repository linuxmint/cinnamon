/**
 * #SignalManager:
 * @short_description: A convenience object for managing signals
 * @_object (Object): The object owning the SignalManager. All callbacks are
 * binded to %_object unless otherwise specified.
 * @_storage (Array): An array that stores all the connected signals. Each
 * signal is stored as an array in the form `[signalName, object, callback,
 * signalId]`.
 *
 * The #SignalManager is a convenience object for managing signals. If you use
 * this to connect signals, you can later disconnect them by signal name or
 * just disconnect everything! No need to keep track of those annoying
 * @signalIds by yourself anymore!
 *
 * A common use case is to use the #SignalManager to connect to signals and then
 * use the @disconnectAllSignals function when the object is destroyed, to
 * avoid keeping track of all the signals manually.
 *
 * However, this is not always needed. If you are connecting to a signal of
 * your actor, the signals are automatically disconnected when you destroy the
 * actor. Using the #SignalManager to disconnect all signals is only needed when
 * connecting to objects that persists after the object disappears.
 *
 * Every Javascript object should have its own @SignalManager, and use it to
 * connect signals of all objects it takes care of. For example, the panel will
 * have one #SignalManger object, which manages all signals from #GSettings,
 * `global.screen` etc.
 *
 * An example usage is as follows:
 * ```
 * MyApplet.prototype = {
 *     __proto__: Applet.Applet.prototype,
 *
 *     _init: function(orientation, panelHeight, instanceId) {
 *         Applet.Applet.prototype._init.call(this, orientation, panelHeight, instanceId);
 *
 *         this._signalManager = new SignalManager.SignalManager(this);
 *         this._signalManager.connect(global.settings, "changed::foo", this._onChanged);
 *     },
 *
 *     _onChanged: function() {
 *         // Do something
 *     },
 *
 *     on_applet_removed_from_panel: function() {
 *         this._signalManager.disconnectAllSignals();
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 */

    this._init(object);

     * connect:
     * @obj (Object): the object whose signal we are listening to
     * @sigName (string): the name of the signal we are listening to
     * @callback (function): the callback function
     * @bind (Object): (optional) the object to bind the function to. Leave
     * empty for the owner of the #SignalManager (which has no side effects if
     * you don't need to bind at all).
     * @force (boolean): whether to connect again even if it is connected
     *
     * This listens to the signal @sigName from @obj and calls @callback when
     * the signal is emitted. @callback is automatically binded to
     * %this._object, unless the @bind argument is set to something else, in
     * which case the function will be binded to @bind.
     *
     * This checks whether the signal is already connected and will not connect
     * again if it is already connected. This behaviour can be overridden by
     * settings @force to be @true.
     *
     * For example, what you would normally write as
     * ```
     * global.settings.connect("changed::foo", Lang.bind(this, this._bar))
     * ```
     * would become
     * ```
     * this._signalManager.connect(global.settings, "changed::foo", this._bar)
     * ```
     *
     * Note that in this function, the first argument is the object, while the
     * second is the signal name. In all other methods, you first pass the
     * signal name, then the object (since the object is rarely passed in other
     * functions).
